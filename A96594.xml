         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that ever ſince 1625. I lived with my <hi>ever-honoured</hi> Lord, and Maſter, the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> for the moſt part, in His <hi>Majeſtie</hi>'s houſe at the <hi>Cock-Pit,</hi> about the ſpace of eighteen years together, and about ſeven years of that time,
<pb facs="tcp:152516:3"/>in His Majeſtie's ſervice; and in that reſpect I had fitter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to obſerve His Majeſtie, and to underſtand the affairs, and Tranſ-actions of the Court better then moſt others of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie's <hi>Chaplains,</hi> that waited only their accuſtomed Moneth, and then returned to their reſidence. And mine <hi>Obligations</hi> to His late Majeſtie are ſo many, and ſo great, that I cannot with the beſt of mine endeavours diſcharge the <hi>Dimidium</hi> of thoſe duties, that low to the bleſſed memory of that King; for he gave me all that I had, and all that I have, and had not the late Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> provided, and commended to His Majeſtie a far better, and abler man every way then my ſelf, His Majeſtie intended to make me the Teacher, and Tutour to Your Majeſtie, as I heard it from His own mouth when my ever Honoured Lord, and Maſter, the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> brought me to examine His Son, and my Scholar, the Lord <hi>Charles Herbert</hi> before His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. And therefore I conceive, that I am more obliged, and bound in Conſcience, to declare what I do <hi>infallibly</hi> know to be truth, to perpetuate the <hi>underſtanding</hi> thereof, unto Poſterities, and to undeceive the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and <hi>Simplest</hi> ſort of people, that know not things aright, but, in hearing the lying reports of moſt <hi>Malicious</hi> men, do ſwallow down the ſame for truths; then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of His late Majeſtie's <hi>Chaplains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I call the great God of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Searcher</hi> of all hearts to be my witneſs, that what I do, is neither out of <hi>Envie, Hatred,</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> to any particular man; or to <hi>Flatter,</hi> and to <hi>Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> my ſelf into the favour of any one the greateſt man living; or for the hope, and expectation, of any benefit, or Preferment in the World; whereas I never did, nor ever intended, to deſire any thing of Your Majeſtie, or of any other, but onely to retain, and to enjoy what our late <hi>Pious</hi> King, and my moſt gracious Maſter, hath given me; becauſe that, although I was Plundered in <hi>England,</hi> and Plundered in <hi>Wales,</hi> and Sequeſtred of all my Means both in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and had not left me one <hi>peny</hi> of any <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Means, nor twenty Pound <hi>per annum,</hi> in all the World, to maintain my ſelf, and my Servants, of any <hi>Temporal</hi> Eſtate; ſo that I was forced for theſe twelve laſt years, and more, to live upon a little <hi>Tenement,</hi> for which I payed fifty ſhillings rent to Sir <hi>Gr. Williams,</hi> and four Pound land by the year of mine
<pb facs="tcp:152516:3"/>own, poorer then poor <hi>Curates,</hi> with <hi>Oaten</hi>-Bread, and <hi>Barly</hi>-Bread, and a little <hi>Butter-Milk,</hi> or <hi>Glas-Door,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Water,</hi> being not able to keep any drop of <hi>Ale,</hi> or <hi>Beer</hi> in my houſe for theſe two <hi>lustra</hi>'s of years, and more, as all my Neighbours know; and to go attired in very mean Country Cloaths, and to do many ſervile works my ſelf, about my <hi>Houſe, Garden,</hi> and <hi>Cattel,</hi> for want of means to hire labourers; yet for all this my ſad condition, leſt I ſhould be <hi>enſnared,</hi> and hindred to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my duty, and my tongue entangled with ſuch Bird-lime, I reſolved to accept of no means, benevolence, or maintenance from the <hi>Uſurpers, Rebels,</hi> and the <hi>Robbers</hi> of the Church of Chriſt, and of their brethren, whatſoever they ſhould offer unto me, and how great ſoever my wants ſhould be; as, being contented, with the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> with any ſtate, or condition, whatſoever, and hoping, that, as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaid of <hi>Pompey,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:152516:4"/>ſo <hi>ready</hi> to forgive His Enemies, and ſo free from all revenge for His greateſt wrongs, that when His own Subjects, and Servants, ſo Undutifully, and <hi>Maliciouſly,</hi> Rebelled, and Warred againſt Him, and beſpotted His <hi>Innocent</hi> Converſation, and pure Life, with moſt falſe, and venomous Aſperſions, I heard him ſay, <hi>I thank God, I can freely forgive all my Enemies, and I pray God, that God would forgive them:</hi> and I dare boldly affirm it, and can juſtifie it, that He was as good a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> if not the beſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, and, I am ſure, the beſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> King, or Prince, that ever <hi>England</hi> ſaw; who, when I came unto Him, immediately after <hi>Edg-Hill</hi>-fight, and ſaid, that whatſoever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we wanted in our Abilities, yet our Prayers ſhould never be wanting, to beſeech the Almighty God, night and day, to bleſs Him, and to protect Him from all His Adverſaries, He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that He thanked us for our Prayers, and deſired us to continue our Prayers ſtill, as He hoped we would do, for Him; becauſe He ſuffered all this War, and whatſoever elſe ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide Him, for our ſake, and for the defence of the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, as it was Eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and for the preſervation of the known Laws of theſe Kingdoms: and all the while I lived in His Court, I never ſaw the man, <hi>Clergy,</hi> or <hi>Laity,</hi> that ſhewed himſelf ſo punctually profeſſing the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion, and ſo <hi>zealouſly,</hi> and <hi>regularly,</hi> obſerving the true ſervice of God, as His gracious Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>What other <hi>Character</hi> I ſhould give to this moſt excellent Prince, for a loving <hi>faithfull</hi> Husband to His Queen, and for a dear <hi>indulgent</hi> Father to all His Children, His goodneſs therein is very very far beyond my ability of Expreſſion; as it is indeed in all the other particulars: ſo that the praiſe, and Eulogie, which <hi>Homer</hi> gave to <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes, Virgil</hi> to <hi>Aenaeas, Xenophon</hi> to his <hi>Cyrus, Euſebius</hi> to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Oſorius</hi> to <hi>Emmanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> I may truly aſcribe to Him, or rather what the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> ſaith of the good King <hi>Joſias,</hi> or the <hi>Scripture</hi> of King <hi>David,</hi> that he was a man according to God's own heart, ſo I hope, and believe, that I may ſay with out miſtake, without offence, that King <hi>Charles the First</hi> was a man according to God's own heart, and though, as Chriſt <hi>non dimidiavit dies ſuos,</hi> ſo God did ſoon bring this good King to His <hi>death,</hi> that He might be ſoon
<pb facs="tcp:152516:4"/>delivered from the contradictions of Sinners, and ſoon brought to enjoy the glorious Crown of Eternal life, yet was He moſt bleſſed, both in His life, and death, as hereafter I ſhall more fully ſhew unto you. And therefore I had rather ſay no more, then to ſay too too little, as I ſhall, when I ſay my beſt of this moſt <hi>gracious,</hi> and now moſt <hi>glorious</hi> King, <hi>Charles the Firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though he was ſo good, ſo gracious, and ſo pious a King; yet this good, gracious, and incomparably pious <hi>Proteſtant</hi> King, the <hi>gentleſt, meekeſt,</hi> and of the <hi>ſweetest</hi> diſpoſition of all the men I ever ſaw, was, as you well know, moſt <hi>rebelliouſly</hi> Warred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, moſt <hi>Judas-like</hi> ſold, moſt <hi>treacherouſly</hi> betrayed, and moſt maliciouſly, <hi>Barbarouſly,</hi> and, for the ſpiteful miſcheivous manner thereof, moſt <hi>Jewiſhly,</hi> and unexpreſſably Murthered; and many more <hi>Noble-men,</hi> and <hi>Gentle-men, Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in <hi>like manner,</hi> onely for His ſake, and for the truth of their <hi>Loyalty</hi> unto Him, and their <hi>Fidelity</hi> unto God, as I have <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically,</hi> and yet fully ſhewed in my Book of <hi>The great Anti-Chriſt revealed,</hi> and in theſe Treatiſes following.</p>
            <p>And can any thing ſo fowly defile the Land, and ſo highly provoke the <hi>Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Indignation</hi> of God againſt his people, as the ſhedding of ſo much <hi>Innocent Blood?</hi> or ſhall we think, that the juſt God will reſt ſatisfied, and contented, to have his Wrath appeaſed (eſpecially, if we conſider what he ſaith to the three ſons of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> ix. 5, 6. and of the <hi>Bloody ſins</hi> of <hi>Manaſses,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> xxiv. 4. and to <hi>Ahab</hi> for letting <hi>Benhadad</hi> to eſcape, 1 <hi>King.</hi> xx. 42.) when he ſeeth the <hi>pretious Blood</hi> of ſo Good, ſo Gracious, and ſo Pious a King, His own <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> and the Blood of ſo many faithfull <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Noble-men, Gentle-men, and other loyal Subjects, that have loſt their lives, for their conſtancie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the true ſervice of God, the right Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and their duty, and loyalty to their true, and lawfull King, left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expiated, and according to the Law of juſtice, unrevenged, and unpuniſhed?</p>
            <p>The truth of God ſaith, Not ſo: therefore His now gracious Majeſtie, leſt His <hi>filiall</hi> affection of ſo good, and ſo loving a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and His anger, and <hi>indignation</hi> againſt ſuch monſtrous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers might ſeem to <hi>tranſport</hi> Him with Paſſion to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, too rigid, and too ſevere, in His cenſure, againſt theſe
<pb facs="tcp:152516:5"/>Murderers, did, moſt wiſely, religiouſly, and Chriſtian-like transmit the Judgment, and Puniſhment of theſe <hi>tranſcendent</hi> Malefactours to his <hi>Parliament,</hi> who, as he knew, had infinitely ſuffered moſt unſpeakable Detriment, and Dammage, as well, though not near the like, nor ſo much as himſelf, in the loſs of their ſo good a King.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>late Parliament,</hi> that was, The Keepers of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Ingland</hi> by the Authority of our Parliament (and you may compute, what Number of Arithmetical Letters this name contained) and had very many of the King's Enemies in it (and therefore likely not to do all things ſo well, as they ſhould do) yet hath it moſt gallantly, religiouſly, and juſtly ſentenced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them to death, and the juſt God, without Queſtion, doth moſt propitiouſly accept, and approve of all thoſe their doings, which are juſt according to his own Precepts.</p>
            <p>But though herein, they have done very well; yet do you think, that they have done ſufficiently well? I will not preſume to teach them, that, in State Affairs, are better able to be my Teachers, then I to adviſe their Wiſdoms, what they ought to have done; yet, as I am <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I muſt humbly crave leave to ſet down, what I conceive to be the juſt Will of God herein; and that is, that all, and every one, that had any hand, or finger in that good King's Death, or in the death of any of thoſe His good Subjects, that were unjuſtly, and illegally ſentenced to death, (I do not ſpeak of them, that were killed in the War; becauſe, as the Poet <hi>Lucan</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pharſal. lib.</hi> 1.
<q>Victrix cauſa Diis placuit, ſed victa <hi>Catoni.</hi>
               </q> And as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Sword devoureth the one, as well as the other:</hi> but of thoſe, that in cold blood, by <hi>uſu ping</hi> Judges, under the Colour of <hi>Law,</hi> were contrary to the <hi>Laws,</hi> both of God, and of the Land, moſt unjuſtly condemned unto death) ſhould, for that their unjuſt Proceedings, be juſtly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, and legally tryed for their former Offence; the ſame being of ſo high a Nature, as I ſhewed to you before.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, many of them, as blinde <hi>Bartimaeus</hi> might eaſily ſee, that acted very highly againſt the <hi>laſt</hi> King, and, as it is
<pb facs="tcp:152516:5"/>conceived, had their hands <hi>deep</hi> in his death, were as <hi>active,</hi> as any others, and moſt ſpecial Inſtruments, to bring His now Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty unto His <hi>Right,</hi> whereby, they have fully expiated their <hi>foul</hi> offence, and deſerve rather to be <hi>well rewarded</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, as ſome ſay they are, then <hi>any</hi> ways queſtioned, as their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> would have them to be.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that His Majeſty is wiſe, as the Angel of God, and knoweth <hi>beſt,</hi> what he ſhould <hi>beſt</hi> do; and the <hi>Policy</hi> of State, is far beyond the <hi>Sphere</hi> of mine <hi>Intelligence,</hi> and their doings therein ought highly to be commended, and deſerve not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be rewarded; though, as <hi>Will. Sommers</hi> told King <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> that ſuch a Gentleman threatned to <hi>kill</hi> him, and the King anſwered, that, if he <hi>killed</hi> him, he would have him <hi>hanged</hi> for it; <hi>Will. Sommers</hi> replied, Nay good King, let him be <hi>hanged</hi> before he kills me, or elſe, his <hi>death</hi> will not preſerve my <hi>life,</hi> and his <hi>hanging</hi> will do me no good: ſo I heard ſome ſay, that they would have had the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the <hi>laſt</hi> King firſt puniſhed for their <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and the <hi>Murder</hi> of Him; and then rewarded for their <hi>good Service</hi> to His now gracious Majeſty, or elſe, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> them well for their <hi>good</hi> Service done to our <hi>now</hi> gracious King, and then queſtion them, and puniſh them anſwerable to their <hi>Deſerts,</hi> for their <hi>Diſloyalty,</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> to our <hi>late</hi> King; as I read it in the <hi>Turkiſh Hiſtory,</hi> and in ſome other <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> of ſome very wiſe Kings, that did ſo to the like Offenders; becauſe, we may believe it for a <hi>truth,</hi> that they, which have proved <hi>falſe,</hi> to their own true, juſt, and lawful Prince, will ſcarce ever prove faithful to any Prince, nor ſeem to be, but either for <hi>hope,</hi> ſtill to reap the fruit of their <hi>Subtlety,</hi> to turn, when the <hi>Winde</hi> turns, or for <hi>fear</hi> to be daſh'd in Pieces, if they turn not their <hi>Sayls</hi> to eſcape thoſe <hi>Rocks;</hi> which they cannot <hi>otherwiſe</hi> avoid; and <hi>no thanks</hi> to ſuch men for <hi>any good</hi> they do, when they do it <hi>perforce,</hi> and therefore ſhould be truſted <hi>perchance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may be, many of the very <hi>Murderers,</hi> both of the <hi>good</hi> King, and of his <hi>loyal</hi> Subjects, have robbed, and ſpoyled, not the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of their <hi>Jewels,</hi> but the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> their Brethren, of their Goods, Lands, and Poſſeſſions, which they have gotten into their own hands, and thereby became <hi>exceeding rich,</hi> and <hi>enabled</hi> themſelves to match their Sons, and their Daughters to
<pb facs="tcp:152516:6"/>great Families, and to beſtow large Gifts, that do blind the eyes of the wiſe, on others, to make to themſelves Friends of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig hteous <hi>Mammon,</hi> to preſerve them from ther juſt deſerts, and to pull down the <hi>Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Vengeance</hi> of God on others, for this their <hi>obstructing</hi> of the ſtraight rule of Juſtice, that teacheth us to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Or, if it were not ſo, many men do wonder, how ſo many men, as were conceived to have been active, and moſt of them to have their hands <hi>embrued</hi> in the good King's Blood, and were likewiſe <hi>guilty</hi> of the death of His <hi>innocent</hi> Subjects, ſhould eſcape <hi>uncenſured,</hi> and ſo few of them ſentenced, to <hi>expiate,</hi> and appeaſe the Wrath of God for ſuch horrible, <hi>unparallebd,</hi> and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Murthers: for I knew eight perſons executed at <hi>Dublin</hi> for the Murther of one ordinary Traveller, and is it not ſtrange, that we ſee no more brought to their Trial for ſuch a <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And I would the <hi>Protectours</hi> of the King's Murtherers would rightly weigh what the people ſayd to King <hi>David,</hi> that His life was worth ten thouſand of the lives of the <hi>common</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and how the Lord puniſhed the whole houſe, and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Saul,</hi> and all the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> until his wrath was ſatisfied, for the innocent death of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> that were but a poor contemptible people, but killed without cauſe; 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> xxi. and eſpecially, that there be not any more, but two ſins, that I can finde, in the whole Book of God, that the Lord

            <p>To whom I have often anſwered that our King is wiſe, as the <hi>Angel</hi> of God, and He knoweth beſt what He hath to do, far better then the beſt of us all, and they ſhould rather remember what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith; <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of the ungodly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thou Envious becauſe of the wicked doers: for they ſhall ſoon be cut down like the Graſs, and be withered like unto the green Herb;</hi> eſpecially when their Iniquitie, their Treaſons, and Treacheries, that as yet are hidden from the Eyes of men, ſhall be found out, and be made apparent unto the World.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152516:8"/>
            <p>And therefore, though I ſay all this, that I ſaid before, as from the <hi>ſtraight,</hi> unpartial rule of <hi>ſevere Juſtice;</hi> yet, as I am a <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of the God of <hi>mercy,</hi> that takes no <hi>delight</hi> in the blood of his Brethren, nor <hi>deſireth</hi> the death of any one; I am obliged moſt humbly, and earneſtly to pray, and beſeech Your <hi>gracious</hi> Majeſty, to be <hi>ſtill</hi> gracious, as You have <hi>demonſtratively</hi> ſhewed Your Self to be hitherto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe <hi>ungracious</hi> Offenders; and when the Law of <hi>Juſtice</hi> hath decreed their <hi>Deſert,</hi> to ſtretch forth unto them the <hi>right Hand</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and to do with them, as the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the moſt <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God</hi> ſhall direct Your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>next</hi> thing, that I am bound to declare, and to remonſtrate unto Your Majeſty, and to all others, is, (leſt Your Majeſty ſhould be <hi>misinformed</hi> concerning me, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Mr. <hi>Secretary Nicholas,</hi> I have been <hi>misrepreſented</hi> in Your Majeſtie's Court,) moſt humbly to beſeech Your Majeſty, to give me leave, to make that Remonſtrance to the World, which I hope no man can contradict: as,</p>
            <p>That I was Your Father's <hi>Chaplain,</hi> and waited on His Majeſty ſix, or ſeven years at leaſt, in the Moneth of <hi>December,</hi> and when the Wars began, though my ever honoured Lord, and Maſter, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and <hi>Montgomery</hi> was mis-led, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Childrens deſire, to adhere unto the Parliament, which fault can no ways be excuſed, though I could ſay very much to leſſen it; becauſe I knew the Uprightneſs of that Noble Perſon, that was hoodwinked by the Subtlety of his Adherents: yet, my ſelf, according to my duty, ſtuck to his Majeſty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded ſome of his Children, that were my <hi>Scholars,</hi> to do the like; and I wrote my firſt Book againſt the Parliament, which is intituled, <hi>The Grand Rebellion,</hi> and, being fetched by a Troop of Soldiers, was carryed Priſoner to <hi>North-hampton,</hi> where the <hi>Committee</hi> had <hi>The Grand Rebellion</hi> in their Hands, and had not God moſt mercifully, and very ſtrangely turned away their eyes, from looking on it, to <hi>preſerve</hi> me, I looked for no other end, then to be utterly ruined; but the Lord preſerved me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me out of their hands: and the next Winter, being in <hi>Oxford,</hi> I printed my <hi>Diſcovery of Myſteries,</hi> or, The <hi>Plots</hi> of the <hi>pretended Parliament,</hi> to overthrow both <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:152516:8"/>on that <hi>very</hi> day, that I was preaching in Saint <hi>Marie's</hi> before the <hi>Parliament,</hi> then ſitting in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Soldiers from <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi> came, and <hi>plundred</hi> my <hi>houſe,</hi> and all my <hi>Houſhold-stuff,</hi> and about eight milch Kine, and all that I had in <hi>Abthorp,</hi> where my Wife, and Children reſided, and ſequeſtred my Lands to the uſe of the Parliament: yet this <hi>Breach</hi> could not <hi>break</hi> my <hi>Loyalty</hi> to my King, or my <hi>Heart</hi> in my Body; but by the next Winter after, I had written my third Book, intituled <hi>The Rights of Kings, and the Wickedneſses of the pretended Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. And according to my poor Ability, out of the Means I had from <hi>Wales,</hi> I gave unto His Majeſties own Hand every Winter, for three years together, the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of my Loyalty, and Affection, to the <hi>uttermoſt</hi> of my Power; and His <hi>gracious</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty did, like a <hi>moſt gracious King,</hi> moſt <hi>favourably</hi> accept of that <hi>Mite,</hi> which I offered Him, as Sir <hi>Bryan O-Neal,</hi> and others do very well know.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Major General Mytton</hi> came, and ſubdued our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Wales,</hi> though the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>York</hi> was my <hi>ſingular</hi> good Friend, and very <hi>earneſtly</hi> perſwaded me to ſubmit unto the Parliament, and, to uſe his own words, ſaid, that I ſhould fare <hi>no worſe</hi> then he did, but ſhould ſail in the ſame Boat, and ſo <hi>ſink,</hi> or <hi>ſwim,</hi> and ſo be ſaved, or deſtroyed together; yet I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that I would never <hi>trust</hi> them, that they would be <hi>true</hi> to me, that <hi>wrote</hi> ſo many Books againſt them, when they were ſo <hi>falſe</hi> unto their King, that had been ſo <hi>gracious</hi> unto them: and therefore I went, and gave ten pound to a Parliament <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain</hi> to let me paſs into <hi>Ireland,</hi> by a moſt <hi>deſperate</hi> Attempt; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>hands,</hi> and through the <hi>Pikes</hi> of mine Enemies, that would have <hi>deſtroyed</hi> me, had they but <hi>known</hi> me: and there how <hi>faithfully,</hi> and <hi>freely</hi> I have often preached for <hi>Obedience</hi> to his Majeſty, and againſt both the <hi>Ingliſh, Scottiſh,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, the moſt Honourable <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ormond</hi> his Grace, and all the <hi>reſt</hi> of the Council at <hi>Dublin,</hi> can ſufficiently teſtifie.</p>
            <p>And when the moſt noble <hi>Marqueſs</hi> could not poſſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Ireland</hi> any longer, but was fain to yield it up unto the Parliament, and I had the <hi>Benefit</hi> of the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and allowed unto me, under the Hands of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, that ſigned them, I was taken at Sea in my Paſſage

<pb facs="tcp:152516:9"/>offer me, and ſent unto me divers ſums of Monies, I refuſed them all, and was faine, before they left ſending to me, to deſire them publikely in the Pulpit at <hi>Dublin,</hi> to offer no more of their gifts, and benevolence unto me (for whoſe love and good will I did moſt heartily thank them) becauſe I Preached not in expectation of any reward, but reſolved to refuſe the ſame, in hope that they would the rather beleive the truth of my <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as I thank God, I ſaw many of them did, though many others were much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me, ſo that I was forced to leave <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſo fell to my <hi>Prayeres</hi> and <hi>Studies</hi> more, and more, to diſcover <hi>The Great Anti-Chriſt,</hi> comforting my ſelf herein, that, if I was not mightily <hi>mistaken,</hi> in all my readings, of the ſence and meaning of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> touching the coming of that <hi>Anti-Chriſt</hi> within three <hi>years and an half</hi> after both the witneſſes were ſlaine, that is, the <hi>King</hi> killed, and all the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> ſilenced, and ſuppreſſed from the <hi>execution</hi> of their <hi>Epiſcopal Function,</hi> which is their <hi>Spiritual</hi> killing, I ſhould, if I ſhould live ſo long, ſee, both Your <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie</hi> Reſtored, to Your <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> Elevated, to their former <hi>Dignitie,</hi> as, bleſſed be God, now both are fully come to paſs, according to mine expoſition of that Propheſie.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Prophetical</hi> expectation, of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration</hi> of theſe two <hi>witneſſes,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true <hi>ſence</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> I made known, and ſhewed it to <hi>very many,</hi> both in <hi>Dublin,</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and in <hi>London;</hi> and though ſome of them, that ſaw <hi>mine expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of thoſe Propheſies, that I thus explained, did but <hi>laugh</hi> at them, and others thought it but a <hi>Fancie;</hi> yet, bleſſed be <hi>the God of Heaven,</hi> that <hi>Revealeth ſecrets unto his Servants,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, we ſee the <hi>truth</hi> of mine Explication, in all things accordingly <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and the <hi>confidence,</hi> that I had in the <hi>aſsurance</hi> of their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> me, to be ſo bold in my <hi>Sermon</hi> before the <hi>Judges</hi> of the general <hi>Aſſizes</hi> at <hi>Conwey,</hi> to ſpeak for Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties <hi>Reſtauration</hi> when You were comming towards <hi>Worceſter,</hi> that, Collonel <hi>Carter,</hi> now Sir <hi>John Carter</hi> (a man then <hi>vehement</hi> againſt Your Majeſtie, and now <hi>loyal</hi> to Your Majeſtie as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others are, that cannot otherwiſe chooſe) told me, as ſoon as ever I had done it, but that he would not ſeem to be <hi>uncivil:</hi> he would have pulled me down by the Ears, out of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now being reſtored to my <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> by the great <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of God, and the happy <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of Your <hi>Sacred</hi> Majeſty, I do moſt humbly crave leave to <hi>remonſtrate,</hi> that as ſoon as I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I went about my <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> in my <hi>Viſitation,</hi> from one end to the other, that I might underſtand the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Country,</hi> where I was <hi>exceedingly</hi> welcomed by all the <hi>old Proteſtants,</hi> as they are termed, in every place; and when I had ſworn <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> and <hi>Sides-men,</hi> or <hi>Aſsistants</hi> in <hi>every</hi> Pariſh, I gave them ſome <hi>Articles</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, and a <hi>convenient</hi> time, to return their <hi>Anſwer</hi> into the Court.</p>
            <p>And when they had <hi>anſwered</hi> to thoſe <hi>Articles,</hi> I found <hi>thereby</hi> (and by what I <hi>ſaw</hi> with mine own eyes in the Country) that the <hi>Presbyterians, Anabaptiſts, Quakers,</hi> and the other <hi>fanatick</hi> Limbs of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the Members of the <hi>Great Anti-Chriſt,</hi> and the falſe <hi>Prophet</hi> that I have ſo <hi>amply</hi> deciphered, in my <hi>last</hi> printed Book of the <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> had <hi>ſuffocated,</hi> and <hi>ſupprest</hi> the <hi>whole uſual,</hi> and <hi>accuſtomed Service</hi> of God; and as they had done in <hi>Ingland,</hi> to his deareſt Servants, ſo in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they had <hi>beheaded</hi> moſt of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within my <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> the <hi>Roofes</hi> of them, both Slates, and Timber, being <hi>quite</hi> taken off, and converted to their own uſe, and the <hi>Walls</hi> of very many of them, <hi>thrown down,</hi> even to the Ground; and of above an hundred <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> I ſaw not ten <hi>Churches</hi> ſtanding, nor half ſo many <hi>well</hi> repaired; they had as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, ſo deſtroyed, <hi>all the Houſes of God in the Land,</hi> as being loath that God, which gave them all they had, ſhould have a <hi>Houſe</hi> for his Servants, to <hi>meet</hi> together, to <hi>praiſe his Name.</hi> And the great, and <hi>famous,</hi> moſt <hi>beautiful Cathedral Church</hi> of Saint <hi>Keney,</hi> they have utterly defaced, and ruined, thrown down all the <hi>Roof</hi> of it, taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

            <p>And for the Preachers, and Miniſters of God's word. <hi>The Great Anti-Christ</hi> had ſo filled the Country with his falſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> Weavers, and Taylors, and the like Preachers, that there were when I came <hi>thither,</hi> but three lawfully <hi>ordained Miniſters,</hi> in all the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Oſsory.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baskervil,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kearney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Deane.</hi> The Labourers were ſo <hi>few,</hi> though the <hi>Harveſt</hi> was very great, eſpecially, if we hoped to <hi>root up</hi> thoſe very many ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Weeds,</hi> that the <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> hath ſowed amongſt us; and for the <hi>Biſhop's Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Slates, Roof, Timber, Windows,</hi> and <hi>Doors,</hi> all carried quite away, and <hi>very much</hi> of the very Walls, thrown <hi>down,</hi> and ruined: <hi>Et ſic periere ruinae:</hi> ſo that it coſt me above thirty pounds <hi>already,</hi> to fit a Room, or two, for me to lay in.</p>
            <p>And for the Lands of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> the <hi>beſt</hi> of them are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>Fee-Farmes,</hi> and a Trifle reſerved to be the <hi>Biſhop's Rent,</hi> ſcarce worth the looking after; and thoſe <hi>pretended Fee-Farms,</hi> with moſt other of the <hi>beſt</hi> Lands, contrary to all the directions of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that, in all his <hi>Commiſsions,</hi> excepted all the <hi>Church-Lands,</hi>

            <p>But if the Biſhops be ſo ſtill kept from their Means, how ſhall we be able to do our Duties, and to diſcharge the Service, that we owe both to God, to our King, and to the Church of God, when the Soldiers divide our Lands, as formerly they did the Coat of <hi>Chriſt</hi> among themſelves; and yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us the full Tale of Bricks, though they take away the Straw wherewith we make them.</p>

            <p>Theſe <hi>Words</hi> that I have read unto you, are the <hi>Words</hi> of the proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Martyr, Saint <hi>Stephen;</hi> the firſt Witneſs, that loſt his <hi>Life</hi> for Preaching the <hi>Truth,</hi> and teſtifying the <hi>Faith</hi> and death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>three fold Act,</hi> or three ſpeciall ſteps, deſcending <hi>down-wards</hi> towards hell, which, with the aſſiſtance of God, I intend to handle, not to <hi>direct</hi> you the way thither, but to <hi>divert</hi> all men from thoſe dangerous pathes, whoſe <hi>ends</hi> muſt be ſo <hi>dolefull</hi> unto them, without end: And they are,</p>

            <p>And yet, as the Poet ſaith,
<q>
                  <l>Clamitat ad Coelum —</l>
                  <l>Vox oppreſſorum, merceſque retenta laborum.</l>
               </q> This <hi>oppreſſion</hi> of the poor <hi>crieth loud</hi> in the eares of God, for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>oppreſſors;</hi>

            <p>And it is the duty of <hi>Children</hi> to love and honor their Fathers, as thoſe that gave them their very <hi>being,</hi> and all the things wherein they delight;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152516:16"/>that is, themſelves; as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid to one that he ſaw <hi>deſpiſing</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And they ought to imitate and to follow their Fathers, in all the good things that they ſee they do.</p>
            <p>But <hi>who</hi> were thoſe Fathers of thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>perſecuted</hi> the Prophets, that we may underſtand whom this <hi>Martyr</hi> meaneth?

            <p>And therefore, when any of theſe <hi>falſe</hi> Prophets ſhould ariſe, and ſeek to withdraw Gods ſervants from the <hi>Truth</hi> and true <hi>God,</hi>

            <p>And yet, theſe <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> were the <hi>only</hi> Prophets, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> magnified; and the <hi>true Prophets</hi> of God, they perſecuted; for <hi>Jezabel</hi> fed 400. of theſe <hi>falſe</hi> Prophets, at her own Table, which was a pretty compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for one woman to maintain; and for <hi>Elias</hi> which was the <hi>true</hi> Prophet of the Lord, ſhe <hi>ſwore,</hi> that ſhe would be the <hi>death</hi> of him, as you may ſee in 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.2.

For if the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> which had no <hi>voice</hi> while it lived, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, <hi>cryed ſo loud,</hi> here on earth, that it was <hi>eaſily heard</hi> in heaven; and it was as <hi>fearful</hi> as it was <hi>loud;</hi> for it was for <hi>vengeance</hi> againſt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then queſtionleſs the <hi>innocent</hi> blood of a <hi>juſt</hi> King, being dead, yet <hi>ſpeaketh;</hi> and ſpeaketh <hi>louder</hi> for vengeance againſt his <hi>Subjects</hi> than the other did againſt his <hi>brother:</hi> which, I fear, without our <hi>ſpeedy</hi> and deep repentance, will be <hi>abundantly</hi> poured out upon this ſinful generation; for that we have ſo <hi>barbarouſly</hi> murdered our <hi>own King</hi> in ſuch <hi>wicked</hi> manner, that I never read the like in any Hiſtory; nor the <hi>Sun,</hi> I believe, did ever ſee the like, ſince the deviliſh <hi>murder</hi> of the King of kings, from which theſe murderers took their <hi>pattern,</hi> to proceed in <hi>like manner</hi> in moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; and herein therefore, <hi>Licet parvis componere magna,</hi> I thought good to <hi>parallel</hi> the practiſes of both ſorts of murderers, the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> murderers.</p>
            <p>The murdered, I confeſs, are <hi>far unlike,</hi> and will admit of <hi>no compariſon,</hi> the difference and <hi>diſtance</hi> betwixt their Perſons, being ſo <hi>great,</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Heaven and Earth, the <hi>Creator,</hi> and the <hi>creature.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begotten by an <hi>earthly</hi> father, as all other men are, and ſubject to <hi>like paſſions</hi> as we are: but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of the Jews, was <hi>conceived by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and free from all ſin, and maſtering all affections. And King <hi>Charles</hi> was <hi>King</hi> but of <hi>ſmall</hi> Territories: But Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>Rex uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſae terrae;</hi> and he was, and is, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords:</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> did good, but to <hi>many,</hi> and hurt but <hi>few,</hi> if he hurt any; but the <hi>King</hi> of the Jews, did good to <hi>all,</hi> and wronged <hi>none:</hi> and ſo in <hi>all</hi> other things, I know, how that the one is <hi>finite,</hi> and the other <hi>infinite,</hi> in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, wiſdom, Power, and <hi>all</hi> other Attributes of excellencies.</p>
            <p>But, if we look how <hi>both</hi> theſe Kings were handled by their <hi>Subjects,</hi> we ſhall find the <hi>later,</hi> not much <hi>unlike</hi> the former, and King <hi>Charles,</hi> hated, traduced, mocked, ſpightfully uſed, and cauſeleſſely killed and <hi>murdered.</hi> And all this in <hi>like manner,</hi> though not, in <hi>every particular,</hi> in like <hi>meaſure,</hi> by his <hi>own Subjects,</hi> as <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt was, by the <hi>wicked</hi> Jews.

            <p>THE Doctrine of <hi>Obedience,</hi> both to God and to our <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King,</hi> and his Magiſtrates, hath been ſo <hi>fully</hi> and ſo excellently handled, by the <hi>Right reverend,</hi> and moſt Worthy and Learned Biſhop of <hi>Downes,</hi> that <hi>more</hi> need not, and <hi>better</hi> cannot be ſaid:</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the <hi>preſſing</hi> of Obedience will avail <hi>little</hi> with the <hi>Rebellious,</hi> if the fear of Gods <hi>judgements,</hi> and the puniſhments of him <hi>that beareth not the Sword in vain,</hi> doth not <hi>terriſie</hi> them from <hi>diſobedience:</hi> for, ſuch is the <hi>frowardneſs</hi> of mans nature, that he would never <hi>fear</hi> God, if he thought God conſiſted <hi>all</hi> of mercy, and were not as <hi>juſt</hi> as He is <hi>merciful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, as you heard, how <hi>neceſſary</hi> is obedience, ſo I intend, by Gods help, to ſhew you the <hi>juſt judgement</hi> of God, and the puniſhment of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious</hi> and diſobedient, upon the words that you ſhall find in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.31. <hi>Had</hi> Zimri <hi>peace, that ſlue his Maſter?</hi>

            <p>And <hi>that</hi> work, I then told mine <hi>Auditors,</hi> I knew not how to do it, in any <hi>better</hi> way, than by paralleling the <hi>tranſcendent</hi> murder of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by thoſe <hi>wicked</hi> Jews, that crucified him, which was their <hi>true</hi> and lawful King, with that <hi>late</hi> unnatural murder that our <hi>Engliſh-Jews</hi> have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, upon their own <hi>juſt</hi> and lawful King, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt: and that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel I then proſecuted, <hi>à capite ad calcem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Text, that I have <hi>now</hi> read unto you, ſeems to be a Queſtion, demanding, What became of <hi>one,</hi> and what ſhould become of <hi>all</hi> others, <hi>wicked murderers,</hi> that like <hi>him,</hi> and like the <hi>other</hi> two ſorts of Jews, ſhould kill both their <hi>King,</hi> and their <hi>Maſter?</hi>

            <p>And the words are a <hi>Speech</hi> made at the entrance of a <hi>brave</hi> Conquerer into a <hi>famous</hi> City, that is, of <hi>Jehu</hi> into <hi>Jezreel.</hi> A cuſtom very often uſed amongſt all Nations, to make <hi>ſolemn</hi> Speeches at the Inauguration of their

            <p>And we do read of two ſpecial <hi>Zimries</hi> in the Book of God; and both of them <hi>wicked</hi> men.
<note place="margin">Numb 25.</note> The firſt you may read of in the 25th of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where you may ſee,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> How that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> contrary to the Command of God, joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Baal-Peor,</hi> and that one <hi>Zimri,</hi> a Prince of a chief Houſe among the <hi>Simeonites,</hi> brought unto his brethren a <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> woman, named <hi>Cozbi,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Zur,</hi> that was Head over a people, and of a chief Houſe in <hi>Midian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> How that, for this <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> of God's Command, the <hi>anger</hi> of the Lord was kindled againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo that he ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord againſt the Sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Iſrael;</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto the Judges of <hi>Iſrael, Slay ye every one his men that were joyned to Baal-Peor:</hi> And ſo they did, that there were ſlain 24. thouſand men.</p>

                  </gap>mri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi;</hi> and that the Lord was ſo well <hi>pleaſed</hi> therewith, that he rewarded him with the covenant of an <hi>everlaſting Prieſthood,</hi> and ſtayed the <hi>plague</hi> from the children of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that, when the plague was ſo <hi>great</hi> among them,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.30.</note> 
               <hi>then ſtood up Phinehas, and prayed, and ſo the plague ceaſed.</hi> And our <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that find ſuch fault with our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> do ſay, That we <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> the Text; becauſe, in the <hi>Original</hi> it is ſaid, That <hi>Phinehas</hi> ſtood up and <hi>executed judgement,</hi> and ſo <hi>the plague ceaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But their carping at this without <hi>cauſe,</hi> hath been <hi>fully</hi> and ſufficiently anſwered, and may be <hi>eaſily</hi> and briefly done; becauſe, he both <hi>prayed,</hi> and <hi>executed judgement;</hi> for the <hi>Text</hi> tells you plainly, That <hi>the people were weeping</hi> before the door of the Congregation, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>6</label> and ſo <hi>praying</hi> to God to turn away his <hi>anger</hi> from them; and <hi>Phinehas</hi> roſe from <hi>amongſt</hi> the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and killed them; and then <hi>the plague ceaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To teach us, that the only <hi>ſure</hi> way to turn away God's <hi>anger,</hi> and the <hi>plagues,</hi> that we deſerve, is not <hi>only</hi> to weep and mourn, and be <hi>ſorry</hi> for the wickedneſſe of the people; but we muſt alſo <hi>execute judgement</hi> upon the transgreſſors:
<note place="margin">Deut. 13.8.</note> and, as the Lord <hi>often</hi> ſets it down, <hi>Thine eye ſhall not pity them, neither ſhalt thou conceal them; but thou ſhalt ſurely kill them:</hi> So ſhall you put away <hi>evil</hi> from among you, and turn away the <hi>judgements</hi> of God from you, which otherwiſe, muſt <hi>ſtill</hi> lie upon you; becauſe <hi>ſins,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>great</hi> ſins, ſuch as are <hi>Idolatry, Rebellions,</hi> and <hi>Murders,</hi> and their <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,</hi> are ſo <hi>indiſſ lubly</hi> linked together, that God ſeldom or never <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi> the one, without <hi>inflicting</hi> the other. And therefore, he would not take away the <hi>plague</hi> from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until <hi>judgement</hi> was executed upon <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi.</hi> And this was the firſt <hi>Zimri,</hi> that we read of, and is not meant here in my Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <note place="margin">1 Kings 16.9.</note> For the other <hi>Zimri,</hi> you may read of him, in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.9. where you may find,</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> How that after this <hi>murder</hi> of their King, and <hi>Zimri</hi>'s poſſeſſing the <hi>Royal</hi> Throne, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was divided, and moſt <hi>miſerably</hi> embroyled in <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> when ſome of them were with <hi>Zimri,</hi> in <hi>Tyrza,</hi> others with <hi>Tibni,</hi> and the reſt with <hi>Omri.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

A <hi>juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of Almighty God, againſt ſuch as would conſpire to <hi>kill their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of this <hi>Zimri, Jezabel</hi> demands the Queſtion, <hi>Had</hi> Zimri <hi>peace?</hi> As if ſhe ſhould have ſaid, Is it <hi>poſſible,</hi> that either <hi>Zimri,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> one of them that conſpired with <hi>Zimri,</hi> and had any <hi>hand</hi> with him, in the murder of their <hi>King</hi> and their <hi>Maſter;</hi> or that very <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that foſtereth <hi>any</hi> of thoſe murderers; ſhould have <hi>any peace</hi> or ſettlement, or any <hi>happineſs</hi> in the world, until <hi>juſtice</hi> and judgement be <hi>executed</hi> upon ſuch <hi>tranſcendent</hi> Malefactors?</p>
            <p>For, ſhe conceived, that, as the wrath of God and his <hi>plagues</hi> were not turned away from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until <hi>Phinehas</hi> ſtood up and <hi>executed judgement</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi;</hi> ſo this <hi>Zimri,</hi> and the Aſſociates of this <hi>Zimri,</hi> and all the <hi>kingdom,</hi> that abetted him, ſhould never have <hi>peace,</hi> nor happineſs, ſo long as <hi>judgement</hi> was <hi>unexecuted</hi> upon them: as the example of <hi>Achan,</hi> and abundance more, doth make it plain, that the executing of <hi>juſtice</hi> and judgement upon <hi>Idolaters</hi> and Murderers, and the like <hi>haynous</hi> offenders, and not ſuffering them to live ſtill in pride and proſperity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, is the <hi>only</hi> thing to procure <hi>peace,</hi> and to turn away God's <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> from any Nation.</p>

            <p n="8">8.

<note place="margin">Gen. 9.5, 6. See Numb. 35.31, 33. Levit. 24.17.

            <p>And yet for all this, we find that he was mightily <hi>hated,</hi> and exceedingly <hi>perſecuted</hi> by them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When God delivered his <hi>Laws</hi> upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> he was pleaſed to be his <hi>own</hi> meſſenger,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.1.</note> to write them with his <hi>own</hi> hands, and to utter them with his <hi>own</hi> mouth;
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.29.</note> but our God being a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, and if he doth but <hi>touch</hi> the mountains, they ſhall <hi>ſmoak,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt;</hi> therefore his <hi>deſcending</hi> to deliver that Law, was ſo <hi>terrible</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſaid,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.21.</note> 
               <hi>I do exceedingly fear and quake;</hi> And they, that <hi>ſaw</hi> the Mount burning, and the <hi>blackneſs, darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>tempeſts,</hi> and heard the ſound of a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and the <hi>voice</hi> of the words, intreated, <hi>That the word ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> that is, by God <hi>himſelf;</hi> becauſe they were not <hi>able</hi> to endure the great and <hi>glorious Majeſty</hi> of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer.</p>
            <p>And yet in very deed, God being an <hi>Infinite</hi> incomprehenſible ſpirit, that hath neither <hi>hands</hi> to handle,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19. Heb. 2.2.</note> nor <hi>mouth</hi> to ſpeak, this <hi>delivery</hi> of the Law <hi>was ordained by Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; And therefore, it being above our <hi>Capacity,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Language of the Angels we know not what it is.</note> which the great <hi>Angelicall</hi> Doctor, the <hi>beſt</hi> of all the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> could not yet determine, what it is; and it being likewiſe beyond the <hi>ability</hi> of our weakneſs, to indure the <hi>ſight</hi> of thoſe <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> ſpirits; God was pleaſed, out of his great <hi>goodneſs,</hi> to condeſcend unto the <hi>infirmities,</hi> and to yeeld unto the <hi>requeſt</hi> of this people, and to ſend his <hi>meſſages</hi> unto us, by ſuch as <hi>dwell</hi> amongſt us <hi>(i. e.) men</hi> like our <hi>ſelves;</hi> that we need, neither to fear their <hi>faces,</hi> nor to ſhun their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi>

<note place="margin">Eſay 53: 1.</note> ſo that, we may <hi>juſtly</hi> cry out with the Prophet, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <note n="2" place="margin">He was their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

               <note place="margin">Deut. 18.15.</note> and you ought the more <hi>readily</hi> to hear him, and the more undoubtedly to believe him, and to love him, becauſe he is of your <hi>brethren:</hi> for, though the Schools have determined, that there is no <hi>love</hi> in hell, nor <hi>charity</hi> among the damned; yet, for his <hi>own</hi> ſake, <hi>Dives</hi> ſeems to have a <hi>care</hi> of his brethren,
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.28.</note> that they ſhould not come into that place of torment:

            </p>
            <p>And for this cauſe, the ſooner to gain <hi>favour,</hi> and to win the more <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi>

               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.42.</note> therefore why ſhould they not <hi>receive</hi> him, and <hi>love</hi> him, that was of their own <hi>Country,</hi> and of their own <hi>fleſh</hi> and blood? Which ſheweth unto us, what a <hi>ſhame</hi> it is, for a Prophet to be without honour, among his <hi>own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,</hi> and in his own Country, where he ſhould be honoured moſt of all? And what an <hi>abominable</hi> thing it is, for a Prince, or a Prophet, to be <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly</hi> betrayed and ſold into the hands of their enemies, by their own <hi>Countrymen,</hi> and their own familiar friends?</p>
            <p>But as our Saviour Chriſt, coming amongſt his <hi>own,</hi> as the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>and his own receiving him not,</hi> but ſlandering, perſecuting and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him unto death, ſaith, <hi>If a ſtranger had done me this diſhonour, I could well have born it;</hi> but I think very <hi>much,</hi> that I ſhould be thus uſed by my <hi>Countrymen,</hi> and by mine own <hi>familiar</hi> friends. So this holy Prophet, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and preaching not to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but to the <hi>Jews,</hi> his own <hi>native</hi> Countrymen, and his own <hi>kindred,</hi> could not chooſe but be <hi>exceedingly</hi> troubled, to be <hi>ſo uſed</hi> as he was amongſt them. For that it is a <hi>greater</hi> ſhame, and a more intolerable ſin, for the <hi>ſervants</hi> of God to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and rejected by their own <hi>Countrymen,</hi> and thoſe that profeſſe and <hi>ſeem</hi> to ſerve the ſame God, and to believe in the <hi>ſame Saviour</hi> as they do, than if they were expelled and deprived of their means, or <hi>perſecuted</hi> unto death, in any <hi>other Country,</hi> where they ſhould be but like <hi>Jonas</hi> among the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> meer ſtrangers. Yet thus was <hi>Jeremy</hi> uſed, and thus are we.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This our Prophet, was not only a Jew, preaching unto the Jews:
<note n="3" place="margin">He was a dear lover of them.</note> for ſo many a man, as <hi>Cateline</hi> among the Romans, <hi>Vortigern</hi> among the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Speed,</hi> l. 7. c. 4. and <hi>Simon, Jaſon,</hi> and others among the Jews, and ſome others nearer home, have betrayed their own Country,
<note place="margin">2 Machab. 4.</note> &amp; the truſt that their Country repoſed in them: but he was a <hi>faithful</hi> Patriot, a <hi>hearty</hi> lover, and no <hi>hater</hi> of his people. <hi>Tertullian</hi> noteth, how dearly <hi>Moſes</hi> loved this <hi>Nation</hi> of the Iſraelites, when rather than God ſhould <hi>deſtroy</hi> them, he <hi>earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly</hi> requeſted, that his own <hi>name</hi> might be blotted out of the Book of <hi>Life.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth the <hi>like</hi> love unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he ſaith, he could wiſh himſelf <hi>accurſed from Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.3.</note> for his <hi>brethren</hi> and kinſmen according to the fleſh. And this our Prophet ſheweth <hi>no leſſe</hi> love unto them than the other, as you may <hi>eaſily</hi> ſee, by this his Propheſie, and his <hi>Preaching</hi> to them, and his <hi>Lamentation</hi> for them. Yet all the <hi>love</hi> of theſe men, and put all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was not <hi>comparable</hi> to the love of Chriſt, who <hi>gave himſelf for them,</hi> and prayed for them, when they <hi>Crucified</hi> him. And therefore, well might he ſay, <hi>Greater love than this hath no man,
<note place="margin">John 15.13.</note> that a man lay down his life for his friends;</hi> which none of all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> nor of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that died all for <hi>themſelves,</hi> and ſuffered death for their <hi>own ſins,</hi> did lay down their life for <hi>others;</hi> as our Saviour Chriſt did, lay down his <hi>life,</hi> not for himſelf, but for his enemies: and yet they loved them very <hi>much,</hi> and very <hi>dear,</hi> as I ſhewed to you before.</p>
            <p>And ſo muſt all the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of Chriſt, and Preachers of God's Word,

               <list>
                  <item>1.
<note place="margin">Jer. 32.33. &amp; chap. 7.25.</note> They have forſaken the <hi>Fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe <hi>two evils</hi> do <hi>commonly</hi> go together: to <hi>ſilence</hi> and deprive the old and <hi>true Preachers,</hi> and to <hi>advance</hi> and magnify the <hi>young novices,</hi> that are fitter to be taught then to teach; yea, to forſake <hi>God,</hi> and then to adore the <hi>Calf;</hi> to throw away the ſervice <hi>of the Lord,</hi> and then to ſet up the ſervice of <hi>Baal;</hi> to perſecute the <hi>true Prophets,</hi> and then to magnify the falſe teachers; 400 of them muſt be <hi>royally</hi> fed on <hi>Jezabels</hi> table, when ſhe would not entertain one <hi>true Prophet.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 18.19.</note> And when, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>corruit in platea veritas,</hi> truth is fallen, and ſhall be troden down, as <hi>mire</hi> in the ſtreets; then <hi>lies</hi> and falſhoods, errors and hereſies, and all blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall be <hi>generally</hi> apprehended, and the broachers thereof, not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the <hi>name</hi> of Preachers, ſhall be <hi>liberally</hi> maintained, as they were by Queen <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and are now by our Parliament-governours in every place.</p>
            <p>Therefore, though the Prophet ſaith, It was <hi>a wonderfull</hi> and a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing,
<note place="margin">Jer. 5.30.</note> that the Prophets <hi>ſhould Propheſy falſly;</hi> yet, I think it was a <hi>greater wonder</hi> for the people <hi>to love to have it ſo,</hi> to hire them ſo <hi>dearly,</hi> and maintain them ſo <hi>bountifully,</hi> for Propheſying <hi>falſly,</hi> and teaching <hi>lies</hi> unto them: For, if <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> had not magnified, and ſo <hi>bountifully</hi> maintained thoſe <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and the people had not <hi>loved</hi> to hear them Propheſying <hi>lies</hi> and falſhoods unto them; it is like enough, they would not have been <hi>ſo ready</hi> to broach ſo <hi>many errors,</hi> and hereſies unto them.</p>
            <p>But what wonder is it for men to <hi>wander,</hi> when they <hi>love</hi> to wander; and to <hi>erre,</hi> when they <hi>deſire</hi> to erre, for, as <hi>Theognis</hi> ſaith,

            <p>But is it not a <hi>wonderful,</hi> and a horrible thing, that men endued with <hi>reaſon</hi> and underſtanding, and men that <hi>pretend</hi> and <hi>ſeem</hi> to be <hi>wiſe</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, ſhould notwithſtanding be ſo <hi>brutiſh</hi> and ſottiſh, as to <hi>love to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and love to be <hi>deceived</hi> and guided out of the <hi>ſervice of God,</hi> to follow after the <hi>vain fancies</hi> of the falſe Prophets?</p>
            <p>Yet you ſee our Prophet tells us, it is ſo with <hi>this people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple love to follow their falſe teachers, rather then the true Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> and you ſhall find it ſo <hi>with many more:</hi> for as the wicked love the <hi>world,</hi> better then the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do love the <hi>Lord;</hi> ſo the Schiſmatick and Heretick, the <hi>Quaker,</hi> the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> the <hi>Independants,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> are more ready to <hi>maintain,</hi> and more affectionate in <hi>their love</hi> to the <hi>falſe teachers,</hi> then the <hi>true Proteſtants</hi> are, to relieve the true and <hi>faithful</hi> Preachers.

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the <hi>falſe</hi> Prophets are more <hi>ſedulous</hi> to gain <hi>Proſelytes,</hi>

            <p>And thus, as <hi>Demodicus</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> that they were no fools, but they did the very ſame things that <hi>fools</hi> did; ſo the wicked politicians, and the hypocritical Saints of this world, they are <hi>no Jews,</hi> but they <hi>do</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>ſame things</hi> that thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> did; they <hi>wander</hi> and erre from the truth, becauſe they <hi>love to wander.</hi> And I would to God we would take as much pains to <hi>go to heaven,</hi> as they do to <hi>run to hell;</hi> and that we would as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly love the <hi>true ſervice</hi> of God, as they love to wander from this <hi>right worſhip</hi> of God.</p>

            <p>Out of all which you may perceive how neceſſary it was for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Gods Church, to ſee that the <hi>ſame God</hi> ſhould have the <hi>ſame Service;</hi> and that <hi>very Service</hi> which himſelf preſcribeth, and not what <hi>new Prayers</hi> and new worſhip, in what <hi>Form,</hi> and under what <hi>words</hi> ſoever, every <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Prieſt</hi> ſhould extemporarily pour forth to the Almighty <hi>God:</hi> For if we ought to be very <hi>carefull</hi> to keep our <hi>feet,</hi> when we go to the houſe of <hi>God, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. then how much <hi>more carefull</hi> ought we to be, to keep our <hi>mouths,</hi> and look to our <hi>words,</hi> which we come to ſpeak in the preſence of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet you <hi>hear</hi> what our Prophet ſaith of this people, that <hi>according to the number of their Cities, were their gods;</hi> and, according to their <hi>ſtreets,</hi> ſo were their <hi>altars,</hi> that is, new gods, and a <hi>new Service</hi> of God, in <hi>every City,</hi> and in every ſtreet; go to <hi>this ſtreet,</hi> and to <hi>this Church,</hi> and you ſhall have <hi>ſuch Prayers,</hi> and ſuch Chapters, and ſuch a <hi>Service</hi> uſed unto the people; but go to that <hi>other ſtreet,</hi> and to that other Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue

            <p n="2">2. <note n="2" place="margin">How this people rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reſiſted their Kings, &amp; their ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</note> Their <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt their Governours, is the ſecond <hi>branch</hi> of their deviation; and this did ever accompany their abuſe of Gods ſervice; for, the King, that is the Supreme Governour under God, is <hi>Cuſtos utrinſque ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae,</hi> The keeper of <hi>God Laws,</hi> and to have a care that God ſhould be <hi>rightly</hi> ſerved; therefore, they that will ſerve God, as they <hi>liſt,</hi> will never obey <hi>their King,</hi> nor ſubmit themſelves to his under-Governours as they ought; for while the <hi>higheſt</hi> wheel of the Clock is put out of temper, and thruſt out of place, all the <hi>reſt</hi> muſt be diſordered.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as this people were moſt prone to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and moſt greedily deſirous of <hi>changes,</hi> and new forms of Gods <hi>Service;</hi> So were they moſt frequent in their <hi>diſobedience</hi> unto their lawful Governours; as you may ſee how <hi>often</hi> they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> againſt the ſons of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> againſt <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and almoſt againſt all the reſt of the <hi>ſucceeding</hi> Kings, even to <hi>Zedechias,</hi> that governed them at <hi>this time,</hi> when our Prophet lived; and was ſo terrified, and <hi>domineered</hi> over by his Nobles and Princes, that he could do juſt nothing, either for the <hi>Service</hi> of God, or the <hi>protection</hi> of Gods Servants. For they ſaid, <hi>We have no King, becauſe we fear not the Lord, what then ſhould a King do to us?</hi> Juſt as I told you,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 10.3.</note> No regard to <hi>Gods ſervice,</hi> and to obey his Precepts, no <hi>obedience</hi> to their King, and his under-Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>And yet,
<note place="margin">Chap. 8. v. 4.</note> if you look but two Chapters before, the Prophet tells us, the Lord ſaith, <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me; and they have made Princes, and I knew it not:</hi> as now we have done, ſet up thoſe for Kings, that God never ſet up. Where you may obſerve, what the Lord <hi>utterly diſliketh</hi> in this people, and what they <hi>principally deſired;</hi> for he blames them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government,
<note place="margin">Chap. 10.3.</note> and ſaying, <hi>We have no King,</hi> or, What ſhall we do with a <hi>King,</hi> or a <hi>Monarch?</hi> We cannot endure that any <hi>one man</hi> ſhould rule and govern us.
<note place="margin">Chap. 8.4.</note> And then you ſee how (Chapter 8.4.) he blames them a great <hi>deal more,</hi> for affecting the <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and making <hi>many</hi> Kings and Princes to govern the people; which is the <hi>greateſt plague</hi> that can happen to any people; and which none but the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> would ſuffer to rule over them.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſay, theſe Dominions are herein infinitely obliged to his Highneſs the Lord Protector, for diſſolving, and diſabling thoſe <hi>many Kings</hi> and Princes, that tyrannized, or were ſuch Tyrants over us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing our Government again, to be as it is, moſt <hi>acceptable</hi> unto God, and moſt <hi>excellent</hi> among men, <hi>Monarchical,</hi> under the Rule of <hi>one</hi> ſupreme Governour.</p>
            <p>And we ſhould all be <hi>doubly obliged</hi> to his Highneſs, if God ſhould put it into his <hi>heart,</hi> and he ſubmit <hi>himſelf</hi> to Gods will, for his own <hi>honour,</hi> which he might gain thereby, and for the <hi>tranquillity</hi> and happineſs of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of theſe Kingdoms, to bring, and ſettle our Government, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he might eaſily do, in the right Line, and on the right Heir, which God and Nature have deſigned for it. For,</p>
            <p>When God hath deſigned a King, to be the Governour over his people, as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> over the Iſraelites, and other Kings ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over his people, how <hi>odious</hi> and how abominable is <hi>diſobedience</hi> to any of thoſe Kings in the fight of God, you may eaſily perceive, if you <hi>mark</hi> how God ſeems to be <hi>more angry</hi> with the conteſtation and <hi>rebellion</hi> of <hi>Corah</hi> and his confederates againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Abſolom</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> and of this people againſt <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dechia,</hi> than he was for the <hi>Idolatry</hi> and impiety they committed againſt himſelf; for if you weigh the <hi>haynouſneſs</hi> of the ſin by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152516:64"/>the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of the puniſhment, which is the only <hi>ballance</hi> that we can judge by, you ſhall find, that <hi>Abſoloms</hi> rebellion againſt his King,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.14.</note> that was his Governour, was more <hi>ſeverely</hi> puniſhed, than his <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.18.</note> or any other his <hi>impiety</hi> againſt God. And leſt you ſhould deny <hi>Abſolom</hi> to have committed any idolatry, by that <hi>Pillar</hi> which he reared in the Kings dale, you may ſee, that the <hi>firſt</hi> and greateſt <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Iſraelites, when they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their <hi>golden Calf,</hi> was puniſhed, but with the death of about 3000. men;
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.28.</note> and yet when they diſobeyed <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>rebelled</hi> againſt him, and it was but a <hi>privative rebellion,</hi> no taking up of <hi>arms,</hi> no plotting of his <hi>death,</hi> but the very <hi>embrio</hi> of a rebellion, and the <hi>beginning</hi> of diſobedience,
<note place="margin">Numb. 16.49.</note> 
               <hi>We will not come at thee;</hi> there died in the plague, <hi>fourteen thouſand</hi> and <hi>ſeven hundred men;</hi> beſides them that died about the matter of <hi>Corah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How ſeverely God puniſheth the rebellious, and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent people.</note> which were no leſs than two hundred and fifty men. For God having appointed the Emperour or King, to be the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Magiſtrate, and commanded him to be the Governour of his people, and to have a ſpecial care of his <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and to be the <hi>Defender of the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> What can this Governour do, to <hi>uphold</hi> the Faith, and to hinder the ſervice of God to <hi>fail</hi> and to fall to the ground, when the people <hi>diſobey</hi> him, and refuſe to be ruled by him, and ſpurn againſt him? as our people have done againſt our King.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though this <hi>diſobedience</hi> to the Magiſtrate, and <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt our King, that is Chief Governour, in it ſelf, if you conſider the <hi>object</hi> of either ſin, is not <hi>equivalent,</hi> nor ſo haynous, as <hi>Idolatry;</hi> yet,
<note place="margin">Why God is ſo angry with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt their Kings.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Government is <hi>ſuſtentaculum,</hi> the prop and ſtay of the <hi>true Religion,</hi> and diſobedience, againſt our lawful Governours, hath alwayes produced the <hi>corruption</hi> of Gods <hi>true Service,</hi> as you may ſee in the rebellion of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> who no ſooner fell from his obedience to his King, but he preſently fell from his duty to his <hi>God,</hi> and corrupted his Service with groſs <hi>Idolatry;</hi> Therefore is God ſo <hi>extreamly</hi> angry, and doth ſo <hi>ſeverely</hi> puniſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and <hi>diſobedience</hi> of the people, as here, becauſe <hi>Zedechia</hi> was not ſuffered by theſe <hi>ſtubborn</hi> and diſobedient people, to follow the advice of this our Prophet; therefore they were all delivered into ſeventy years Captivity.</p>
            <p>And as the Lord is <hi>extream</hi> angry with thoſe rebellious people, that <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey</hi> and labour to diſplace the Kings and Governours that he ſets over them; So he ſheweth abundance of his <hi>love</hi> and kindneſſe to them, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to his ordinance, and behave themſelves dutifully and <hi>loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> towards thoſe Kings whatſoever they be, that God placeth over them; as you may ſee it in the whole <hi>courſe</hi> and Story of King <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> for as he was the moſt dutiful and moſt <hi>faithful ſubject,</hi> that ever we read of; ſo God was pleaſed to raiſe him to be the <hi>beſt King</hi> that ever reigned over Iſrael; for, his King, and his Governour was <hi>Saul,</hi> the very <hi>firſt</hi> of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among the Jews; and he was an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> a perſecutor, a murderer, a tyrant, and a mad man; yet when <hi>David,</hi> whoſe life he thirſted after, had him at his <hi>mercy,</hi> and could as eaſily have taken off his <hi>head,</hi> as to cut off the <hi>lap</hi> of his garment, he ſaid, <hi>The Lord forbid,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And when he had him again in the <hi>like trap,</hi> he ſaid unto <hi>Abner,</hi> Art not thou a <hi>valiant man,</hi> and who is like thee in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> wherefore then haſt thou not kept <hi>thy Lord the King?</hi> this thing is <hi>not good,</hi> that thou haſt done; <hi>As the Lord liveth,</hi> you are worthy to die, becauſe you have not <hi>kept your Maſter,</hi> the Lords <hi>Annointed,</hi> and his oath; <hi>As the Lord liveth,</hi> ſheweth,

            <p>And if they be worthy <hi>to die,</hi> that <hi>defend</hi> not, and protect not, ſuch a <hi>wicked</hi> King, eſpecially in going about ſo <hi>vile</hi> an action, as the murdering of ſo <hi>good a man,</hi> and ſo dutiful a ſubject as <hi>David was;</hi> then what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

            <p>But to go on to ſhew unto you, how faithful this <hi>good ſubject</hi> was to this bad King, when the young man, that was an <hi>Amalekite,</hi> and none of <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Davids</hi> ſubjects, came of his <hi>own accord,</hi> to bring tidings unto <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Sauls</hi> death, and of the <hi>good ſervice,</hi> that he thought he had done unto <hi>Saul,</hi> at his own requeſt, to put him out of his pain; <hi>David</hi> preſently cauſed him to be put <hi>to death;</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">Sam. 1.15.</note> becauſe he durſt preſume to offer <hi>any violence,</hi> though that <hi>violence</hi> ſeemed to be a <hi>favour,</hi> unto the <hi>Ruler</hi> of the people, whom we are ſtraightly forbidden to <hi>revile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 22.28.</note> or to ſpeak evil of him.</p>
            <p>So dutiful and ſo <hi>loyal,</hi> a ſubject was <hi>David,</hi> to ſo evil a Governour, and ſo wicked a King as <hi>Saul.</hi> And this his loyalty and <hi>fidelity</hi> unto <hi>Saul,</hi> was one of the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> vertues that we find <hi>commendable</hi> in him, before God had, according to his fidelity to his King, raiſed him to the Rule and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of his people.</p>
            <p>And I wiſh that all, and every one of us, would ſtrive and ſtudy to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this good man in our obedience, fidelity, and loyalty, to our King and Governours, that God hath placed over us.</p>
            <p>But here, it may be, ſome troubled and <hi>diſcontented</hi> ſpirit will ſay; I could willingly yield all due reſpect and obedience unto our Kings and Governours, could I be ſatisfied, that God <hi>appointed</hi> them to be the Kings and Governours of his people;
<note place="margin">Jeremy 23.21.</note> but as the Lord ſaith of the <hi>falſe Prophets, They run and I ſent them not;</hi> So he ſaith, <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me,

            <p>And yet theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> whereof the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaketh, ſought with all rigor, to <hi>compel</hi> men to <hi>ſwear</hi> unto their <hi>wicked covenant;</hi> and thereby, ſaith our Prophet, <hi>Their skirts were filled with the blood of the ſouls of the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents;</hi> when, to ſave their <hi>eſtates,</hi> they believed their <hi>faith,</hi> and became ſuch <hi>hypocrites</hi> before God, for fear of men, as made them moſt <hi>liable</hi> to Gods heavy <hi>judgements;</hi> which muſt needs be <hi>no ſmall</hi> offence in <hi>this people,</hi> and in all thoſe, that <hi>imitate</hi> them herein.</p>
            <p>But let this <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and the ſin of this people, be what it will, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all from the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of their Divines, and falſe Prophets;
<note place="margin">The Aſſembly of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſe of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Jer. 23.13.14,</note> 
               <hi>For they cauſed my people Iſrael to erre, and they ſtrengthened the hands of the evil doers, that none doth return from his wickedneſs,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. For indeed, we that are the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the people, are juſt like <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Figs, They that were <hi>good,</hi> were very good, and they that were <hi>bad,</hi> were <hi>very bad:</hi> So are we, either the <hi>beſt,</hi> or the <hi>worſt</hi> of men; and we either bring men to Chriſt, or ſend them to the Antichriſt; either make them <hi>Saints,</hi> or make them <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> and Hereticks; and through our pride, covetouſneſs, and ambition, we <hi>lead them,</hi> like fools as they are that follow falſhood, into <hi>all miſchief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore from the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>peaſant,</hi> from the higheſt to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, all men ought to be <hi>wary</hi> whom they affect, and chuſe to be <hi>their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;</hi> For it is moſt true, that, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Like Prieſt, like people;</hi> unleſs it be, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, That now, <hi>the Prieſt is worſe than the people.</hi> For we know, the <hi>Arian Biſhops</hi> made <hi>Conſtantius</hi> an Arian Emperour; and the <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> made <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> ſo <hi>zealouſly</hi> affected to the ſervice of <hi>Baal.</hi> So the <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> Prieſts, make their followers <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and the <hi>popiſh</hi> Prieſts make <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore all <hi>great men,</hi> Kings, Princes, and Governours, ought to have a <hi>ſpecial</hi> care, to chuſe <hi>Orthodoxal</hi> men to be their <hi>Chaplains,</hi> and all men ought to have the <hi>like care,</hi> to follow the Doctrine of the <hi>true Preachers,</hi> and to be as willing to hear the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>true Preachers,</hi> as the <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> and falſe Prophets. For if <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> would have hearkened to <hi>Micaiah</hi> as well as they did to the <hi>Prophets of Baal,</hi> it is very likely <hi>Baal</hi> had not been ſo much <hi>worſhipped,</hi> nor the <hi>true Service</hi> of God ſo much <hi>neglected.</hi> But S. <hi>Gregory</hi> l. 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 38. ſaith moſt truly, <hi>Rex ſuperbiae prope eſt, &amp;, quod dici nefas, ſacerdotum ei praeparatur exercitus.</hi>

            <p>And herein <hi>this City,</hi> and this Kingdom, is now very happy, that God hath ſent them ſo <hi>Religious,</hi> and ſo Noble a <hi>King,</hi> as doth favour and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the <hi>true Proteſtants,</hi> and is not <hi>apt,</hi> to believe the <hi>aſperſions,</hi> that the <hi>falſe brethren</hi> are ſo ready to caſt upon them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And this our Prophet further ſheweth, How this great miſchief, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, covetouſneſs, injuſtice, and all other wickedneſs, happened to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo <hi>general</hi> among this people; and that was, When the <hi>unity</hi> of the Clergy, and <hi>uniformity</hi> of Gods ſervice, was divided into many <hi>Sects,</hi> and different ſorts of ſerving God;
<note place="margin">Jer. 12.10.</note> for, <hi>many Paſtors have deſtroyed my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> ſaith the Prophet: not becauſe they were <hi>many,</hi> had they been all of one mind; but becauſe they were of many <hi>different</hi> minds; as were the <hi>Scribes</hi> Phariſees, Sadduces, Herodians, Eſſeni, and many <hi>other</hi> inferiour Sects among the Jews; as now <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> Independants, Anabaptiſts, Papiſts, Quakers, Dippers, and many <hi>Sects</hi> and Factions are among us: when the Church of God that ſhould be, <hi>tanquam Acies ordinata,</hi> like a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Army, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) governed by the General, and his ſubordinate Officers, and not be commanded by a multitude of unequal, and all <hi>diſſenting</hi> Commanders, ſhall be inſtructed by a company of diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Preachers; whereof moſt of them ſhall be like <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Prieſts, and each one of them an Independant, to command in <hi>Chief,</hi> to gather a Church for himſelf, whereof no man elſe ſhall have any intereſt from them; and then only Gods <hi>pleaſant portion</hi> as the Prophet calleth the Church,

            </p>
            <p>And therefore queſtionleſs, great is the <hi>account</hi> that theſe Prophets have to <hi>anſwer</hi> for, at the laſt Day; not only for their <hi>own ſins,</hi> which they never look into, but do reprove <hi>others</hi> for their covetouſneſs, and are <hi>more cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> themſelves; and do moſt <hi>eagerly</hi> inveigh againſt the <hi>pride,</hi> hatred, and malice of the <hi>people,</hi> and never look into their <hi>own pride,</hi> nor conſider of their own <hi>fouler faults,</hi> but eſpecially for thoſe ſins alſo, which either by their <hi>evil example,</hi> or their <hi>falſe Doctrine,</hi> they are the <hi>cauſe</hi> thereof in the people.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And 1. this word <hi>Honour,</hi> doth properly ſignifie <hi>that reverence</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which we owe, and do render to <hi>any one,</hi> for any cauſe.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there are <hi>many things</hi> for which we yield and exhibite <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What is meant by Honour.</note> it followeth that this word <hi>Honour</hi> doth not ſignifie the <hi>ſame thing</hi> in all places; But <hi>pro diverſitate diverſae materiae, diverſa ſignificat;</hi> it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>divers things,</hi> according to the diverſity of the <hi>ſubject matter:</hi> As,</p>
            <p>Among <hi>prophane</hi> Authors it is taken many wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes for the <hi>beauty,</hi> and comelineſs of any thing; as where the Poet ſaith,
<q>Frigidus &amp; ſylvis Aquilo decuſſit honorem.</q> The cold <hi>Northren wind,</hi> ſhook off all the <hi>honour,</hi> that is, all the <hi>beauty</hi> and grace of the Wood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes it is uſed for that Obſervance and <hi>worſhip,</hi> that we yield unto our <hi>Superiours,</hi> for the good that we receive from them; as when the Poet ſaith,
<q>Semper honore meo, ſemper celebrabere donis.</q> I will alwayes <hi>worſhip,</hi> or ſerve, and reſpect you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes it is taken for the <hi>reward,</hi> that is given for any thing; as where it is ſaid,
<q>Ipſis praecipuè ductoribus addit honores.</q> And ſpecially, he rewarded the Captains and Commanders. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sometimes it is put for the <hi>Rites</hi> and Ceremonies of our <hi>Funerals;</hi> as where <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith,
<q>Cernit ibi maeſtos &amp; mortis honore earentes.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Virgil. Aeneid.</hi> 6.</note>
               </q> And there he beheld them ſad, that wanted the <hi>due Rites</hi> and honour of their Burials; which now, many <hi>Worthy</hi> men do want, among our <hi>new</hi> Prognoſticks.</p>
            <p>So in the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> it is likewiſe taken <hi>ſeveral</hi> wayes. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes for <hi>eſteem</hi> and worth, as where the Apoſtle ſaith, Thoſe Ceremonies, <hi>Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not,</hi> are not in <hi>any honour;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.23.</note> that is, of <hi>any worth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes for an <hi>honeſt care,</hi> and proviſion for one; as where S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, That the Husband <hi>ſhould give honour to the wife;</hi> that is, to care and <hi>provide</hi> for her, as for the weaker veſſel.

            <p n="3">3. <note place="margin">Rom. 13.7.</note> Sometimes it is put for that reverence, <hi>worſhip,</hi> and <hi>ſervice,</hi> which is due to <hi>our governours</hi> and magiſtrates, as where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>render to all their dues, honour to whom honour belongeth;</hi> that is, render to every one that <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> which is due to <hi>him,</hi> and is not due to another; and ſo it is taken <hi>here,</hi> in the <hi>laſt Precept, Honour the King,</hi> that is, with <hi>ſuch</hi> an honour, as is due to the <hi>King,</hi> and is not due to <hi>all others;</hi> becauſe <hi>all men</hi> are not to be honoured <hi>alike;</hi> and to have the <hi>like</hi> honour, as well the one as the other: otherwiſe <hi>the King,</hi> or <hi>the Father;</hi> the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> or the <hi>Maſter</hi> is to have no <hi>more honour,</hi> then a <hi>beggar;</hi> and therefore, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Honour all men,</hi> he doth not mean,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.17.</note> that <hi>all men</hi> ſhould be honoured <hi>alike,</hi> when the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>The Elders that rule well</hi> are worthy of <hi>double honour.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sometimes this word <hi>Honour,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>any kind</hi> of duty, reverence, obedience, relief, <hi>&amp; quaelibet charitatis officia,</hi> and all other offices of love and charity;
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.10.</note> as where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Be kindly affectionated one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another.</hi>

<note n="1" place="margin">We are to help all that are in need of our help.</note> 
               <hi>honour all men,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>eſteem,</hi> love, aid, and <hi>help all men</hi> that have <hi>need</hi> of help, ſo far forth as you are <hi>able</hi> to help them; comfort thoſe that <hi>mourn,</hi> relieve thoſe that <hi>want,</hi> inſtruct them that are <hi>ignorant,</hi> and ſo <hi>help</hi> all that are in <hi>need</hi> of your help; for, as <hi>Boetius</hi> ſaith,

So, he that <hi>feareth God,</hi> will not purchaſe <hi>peace,</hi> nor compaſſe his own <hi>deſire,</hi> though it were with the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to be freed out of bondage, or with <hi>David,</hi> to gain a Kingdom, with the <hi>leaſt tranſgreſſion</hi> of Gods Will, or the connivence with the <hi>leaſt breach</hi> of Gods Precepts, or the leaſt <hi>alteration</hi> in Gods own Ordinances.</p>
            <p>And therefore if theſe men <hi>fear God,</hi> they will prefer <hi>his wayes</hi> before their <hi>own,</hi> and they will have a ſpecial care <hi>to all his Precepts.</hi> I will only name <hi>thoſe</hi> that are contained in my Text. <hi>Honour all men.

            <p>And now I demand, how they have performed theſe things?

            <p n="3">3. As <hi>love</hi> inflameth the <hi>deſire</hi> to do what is <hi>acceptable</hi> unto God, ſo <hi>fear</hi> hateth to do what is <hi>abominable</hi> unto him; and as love keepeth his <hi>Precepts,</hi> ſo fear loatheth to break <hi>his Commandments;</hi> and as love <hi>mitigateth</hi> the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which fear cauſeth, ſo fear <hi>qualifieth</hi> the joy which love produceth.

And while we are in this world, both <hi>grow together</hi> in the heart of <hi>every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever:</hi> And, as the Poet ſaith of <hi>another kind</hi> of love, ſo I may more truly ſay of this Divine love,
<q>Res eſt ſoliciti plena timoris Amor.</q> This love of God is full, not of <hi>diſtruſtful,</hi> but of <hi>careful</hi> fear. <hi>Quia timentes Deum non erunt incredibles verbo Illius,</hi> ſaith the ſon of <hi>Sirach.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the wicked have neither <hi>true fear,</hi> nor <hi>perfect love.</hi> For, though <hi>Cain, Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> had a kind of <hi>fear;</hi> yet was it <hi>falſe,</hi> becauſe it wanted <hi>love.</hi> And though the Phariſees and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> had a kind of <hi>love,</hi> yet was it but <hi>counterfeit,</hi> becauſe it wanted <hi>fear:</hi> for if the former had had <hi>love,</hi> they would have deſired <hi>favour,</hi> and ſhould have obtained <hi>grace;</hi> and if the other had had <hi>fear,</hi> they would have aimed at Gods <hi>glory,</hi> and not have ſought their own <hi>praiſe,</hi> which did work their <hi>own confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, well might S. <hi>Peter</hi> enjoyn every Saint that <hi>loveth</hi> God, to <hi>fear God:</hi> And as the <hi>love of God,</hi> ſo the <hi>fear of God,</hi> is ſometimes put for a <hi>part</hi> of Gods Service, and ſometimes for the <hi>whole Service of God:</hi> and ſo it is in <hi>this place,</hi> as in the firſt of <hi>Job;</hi> and in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.50. and in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in many places: As, where he ſaith, <hi>Come ye children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord;</hi> where the <hi>fear of God</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>whole Worſhip of God,</hi> to <hi>honour</hi> him, <hi>obey</hi> him, <hi>truſt</hi> in him, <hi>pray</hi> unto him, and what duty ſoever elſe <hi>we owe</hi> unto him. And thus the <hi>fear</hi> of God is the <hi>rareſt Jewel,</hi> and the moſt excellent thing in the World: No <hi>riches,</hi> no <hi>honour,</hi> no <hi>preferment</hi> like unto it. No <hi>evil</hi> ſhall happen to them that <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> but God ſhall <hi>preſerve</hi> them in temptation, <hi>&amp; liberabit eos à malis,</hi>

            <p>And truly, this hath bred <hi>abundance</hi> of the children of diſobedience, that though <hi>Hoc erit artis opus,</hi> yet every one will be ſuch a <hi>Doctor</hi> as to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

<note place="margin">Joſeph. Antiq.</note> though he were never ſo wicked.

            <p>But you will ſay, What if my King ſeek to <hi>kill</hi> me, for ſo now the <hi>Rebels</hi> have aſcended to that <hi>height</hi> of impiety, that they are not aſhamed, thus <hi>ſlanderovſly</hi> to taxe him, and moſt <hi>falſely</hi> to accuſe him?

            <p>To reſolve this Queſtion, I demand of thee, What if thy father ſeek to kill thee, Mayeſt thou rather kill him, than be killed?</p>

            <p>And yet the King, to whom the <hi>Paternal-right</hi> is transferred, is more than any private Father; for he is the <hi>publique</hi> Father of us all, under whom we we may lead a <hi>quiet,</hi> and a <hi>peaceable</hi> life in all godlineſſe and honeſty,

            <p>That aid is not good, when it doth <hi>no good;</hi> but doth a great deal of ill, becauſe we depended on it, and were <hi>diſappointed</hi> of it.

            <p n="1">1. The heathen man could tell us, that <hi>boni paſtoris eſt pecus tondere, non deglubere;</hi> it is the part of a good Shepherd to <hi>fleece</hi> his ſheep, and not to <hi>flea</hi> them, that is,

<note place="margin">John 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then the good Shepherd is not to be <hi>harſh</hi> and rough, but <hi>gentle</hi> and meek unto his ſheep; for the <hi>ſheep</hi> are gentle creatures, and therefore they muſt be <hi>gently uſed,</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">Not prove too harſh unto them.</note> and gently <hi>led,</hi> and not <hi>forced;</hi> for ſo the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Duxiſti populum ſicut oves, non traxiſti,</hi> God <hi>led</hi> his people like ſheep, and <hi>drove</hi> them not, like horſes; And therefore when <hi>Eſan</hi> would have <hi>Jacob</hi> to drive his flock ſo, as to keep him company in his <hi>hunting</hi> pace; <hi>Jacob,</hi> that was a skilful <hi>ſheep-maſter,</hi> anſwereth him, not ſo Sir, for it is a <hi>tender</hi> cattle, that is under my hands, and muſt be <hi>ſoftly</hi> driven,
<note place="margin">Gen. 33.</note> ſo as they may endure; or if one ſhould <hi>over-drive</hi> them but one day, they would all die, or be laid up for <hi>many</hi> dayes after.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Rehoboam</hi> left ten parts of his flock behind him, only for his <hi>rough</hi> driving of them, and his <hi>harſh</hi> carriage towards them; for when in a barbarous manner he chaſed his ſheep before him, and told them what <hi>yokes</hi> he would make for them (a far <hi>unmeet</hi> occupation for a Prince to be a <hi>yoak-maker</hi>) they all <hi>ſhrunk</hi> from him, and ran away <hi>preſently,</hi> and ſo clean <hi>falſified</hi> his Propheſie; for whereas he told them <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,</hi> that his <hi>little</hi> finger ſhould be as <hi>big</hi> as his Fathers body, it fell out clean contrary: for his <hi>whole</hi> body proved not ſo <hi>big</hi> as his Fathers little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>good</hi> Shepherd, whether you mean <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Prieſt,</hi> will come down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his ſheep, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſheweth, not like <hi>ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. For the affirmative or poſitive duties of a good Shepherd,
<note n="2" place="margin">Affirmative what he ſhould do to his ſheep.</note> they are eſpecially theſe four.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To provide for his ſheep <hi>ſweet</hi> and freſh paſture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To foreſee and to take care <hi>how</hi> they ſhould feed in that paſture; that is, when and how much they ſhould eat thereof; for if the ſheep be not <hi>warily</hi> looked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in a <hi>freſh paſture,</hi> inſtead of being <hi>fatted,</hi> they may very eaſily be ſpoiled, when

            <p n="3">3. To protect and <hi>defend</hi> them from the fury of their Foes, Wolves, Dogs, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes, and the like ravenous Beaſts, that do <hi>continually</hi> ſeek to diſturb and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To <hi>watch</hi> over them, leſt by their <hi>wandring</hi> they ſhould miſcarry and be loſt, or otherwiſe periſh out of the way.</p>
            <p>And in all theſe reſpects, beſides many others, our Saviour Chriſt hath <hi>approved</hi> himſelf to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that good Shepherd, which excelled all the beſt Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of the world: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <note n="1" place="margin">How Chriſt performed the negative part of a good Shepherd.</note> Touching the <hi>negative</hi> duties of a Shepherd, Chriſt came not to gather <hi>wealth</hi> with <hi>Craeſus,</hi> nor to enlarge his dominions with <hi>Alexander,</hi> but to ſave our <hi>ſouls;</hi> and ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſeek not yours, but you;</hi> and ſo every <hi>faithful Miniſter</hi> of Chriſt ſhould not ſo much hunt after the <hi>wealth</hi> of their flocks, as the <hi>health</hi> of their ſouls; though this denieth not, but as the <hi>Sheep</hi> ſhould yield her <hi>fleece</hi> unto her Shepherd, ſo ſhould the people pay all dues and <hi>duties</hi> unto their Miniſter; for, as S.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.7.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as he came not to <hi>enrich</hi> himſelf by his people, ſo he was no wayes <hi>harſh</hi> and ſevere unto his people;
<note place="margin">Num. 12.3.</note> but, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>meekeſt</hi> man upon earth, and carried the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his <hi>boſom,</hi> as a <hi>nurſing</hi> Father beareth a <hi>ſucking</hi> Child, to uſe <hi>Moſes</hi> his own words;
<note place="margin">Num. 11.12.</note> ſo was Chriſt meek and lowly in heart, and never denied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>ſought</hi> unto him, nor failed any man that <hi>truſted</hi> in him. And ſo he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all his Miniſters to be <hi>gentle</hi> and courteous unto the people; for, as the very heathen ſaith,
<q>
                  <l>—Peragit tranquilla poteſtas</l>
                  <l>Quod violenta nequit.—</l>
               </q> We may ſooner win men by <hi>perſwaſion</hi> then by <hi>compulſion,</hi> rather by fair meanes and a ſweet language, then by <hi>foul means</hi> and rough terms: as it appeareth by that parable which <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſetteth down, of the conteſtation betwixt the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Wind,</hi> which of them was moſt <hi>powerfull</hi> to make the traveller caſt off his <hi>cloak,</hi> who the <hi>faſter</hi> the wind blew, the <hi>faſter</hi> he held his cloak about him; but the Sun, with the <hi>influence</hi> of his firſt ſweet, and then <hi>piercing</hi> beams made him quickly to caſt off both his cloak and his coat.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>ſuch a Shepherd</hi> of Chriſt his flock, as the Poet ſpeaks of, — <hi>Non pater eſt Aeacus,</hi> that is not the <hi>gentle</hi> Child of this <hi>meek</hi> Father, but <hi>Te ſaxum te genuere ferae,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>churliſh</hi> and rough hewn <hi>Nabal</hi> was to <hi>David,</hi> is fitter to <hi>drive</hi> wild Horſes then to <hi>lead</hi> the harmleſs ſheep; and they do rather <hi>chaſe</hi> men, like <hi>Nimrod,</hi> from the Lord, then <hi>win</hi> them with S. <hi>Paul</hi> by all fair means to our Saviour Chriſt, as you may ſee, how he ſeeks to lead the <hi>Romans</hi> unto Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>I beſeech you brethren,

            </p>
            <p>Which makes me wonder at thoſe <hi>rough collectors</hi> of Churches out of the Church of Chriſt, by receiving <hi>ſome</hi> and rejecting <hi>others</hi> into their flock, as if the <hi>day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were now come,

               <note place="margin">Prov. 25.16.

<note place="margin">Prov. 27.7.</note> the <hi>full ſoul loatheth,</hi> or treadeth under foot the <hi>honey-comb;</hi> but to the <hi>hungry ſoul</hi> every bitter thing is ſweet, ſo is the Word of God precious, when it is not ſo <hi>plentiful,</hi> and deſpiſed when we are full of it.</p>
            <p>And truly I do believe,
<note place="margin">Knowledge how more plentiful now then ever it was.</note> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt and the reſt of the holy Scriptures were <hi>never</hi> ſince Chriſt his time ſo <hi>fully,</hi> and ſo <hi>generally</hi> and ſo <hi>truly</hi> publiſhed as of late they were in the reigne of our late King <hi>CHARLES;</hi> for you know it is not long ſince the Word of God was had in our <hi>native</hi> language, but it was locked up in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues, which none but a few ſcholars underſtood; and ſince it is <hi>vulgarly</hi> publiſhed, you may conſider how many <hi>Bibles</hi> are now printed to furniſh every Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, maid and boy, in compariſon of the <hi>ſmall</hi> number that the <hi>beſt</hi> men had in <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> times; and for <hi>Sermons,</hi> how <hi>rare</hi> were they in our fathers times, and how <hi>generally</hi> you may hear them now at <hi>all times</hi> in <hi>moſt places?</hi> and the Angel fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> it ſhould be <hi>thus</hi> before the <hi>end</hi> of the world; for, ſaith he, <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be encreaſed,</hi> as now it is, I think ten times <hi>more</hi> then <hi>ever</hi> it was: <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. And therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea,</hi> Hab. 2.14.</p>
            <p>And yet, notwithſtanding all the <hi>multitude</hi> of our Bibles, all the <hi>volumes</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Treatiſes, all the <hi>frequent</hi> Sermons that are made, and all the <hi>knowledge</hi> that is profeſt, from the <hi>learned ſcribe</hi> to the <hi>City-tradeſman,</hi> &amp; the Country <hi>plough-man,</hi> our Saviour tells us, that when he cometh, <hi>Iniquity ſhall be encreaſed, the love of many ſhall wax cold,</hi> and he ſhall ſcarce <hi>finde faith upon the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any man demand with <hi>Nichodemus, How can theſe things be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, That the more <hi>good wheat</hi> we ſowe in the field of Gods Church, the <hi>more tares</hi> will Satan ſow amongſt it, and the more we ſtrive to <hi>enlarge</hi> the true faith, the more <hi>errours</hi> and hereſies will his inſtruments ſpread amongſt the people; and for <hi>knowledge,</hi> he knoweth enough, and too much himſelf, and is very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that all his ſervants ſhould be <hi>knowing men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Devil would have all to be knowing men.</note> and be as skilful in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as he is himſelf; for, as one <hi>crafty knave</hi> can do ten times more miſchief then ten <hi>ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fooles,</hi> ſo one <hi>learned heretick</hi> will broach <hi>more errours,</hi> and defend and maintaine them <hi>far better</hi> then many <hi>meaner ſcholars</hi> can do; and it is a true <hi>axiom,</hi> that <hi>Non niſi ex magnis ingeniis magni errores,</hi> the great errours never ſprung, and the ſtrange hereſies could never have been maintained, but by men of ſome good parts, and of <hi>great knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore I may juſtly ſay with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>Melior eſt fidelis ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, quam temeraria ſcientia,</hi> it were far better for men to be <hi>humbly ignorant,</hi> then <hi>proudly filled,</hi> and raſhly erring with <hi>knowledge;</hi> for, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Knowledge puffeth up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.1. Eſay 47.10.</note> and many times produceth <hi>many</hi> errours and <hi>much</hi> evil, even as the Lord ſaith of <hi>Babylon, Thy wiſdome and thy knowledge have perverted thee, and cauſed thee to turn away from the right way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the raſh, proud and <hi>unſanctified</hi> knowledge of men doth breed <hi>many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> and much evil, ſo it bringeth <hi>no good</hi> at all; for, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>not the hearers of the law,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.13.</note> but the doers of the law ſhall be juſtified,</hi> ſo not the <hi>knowers</hi> of the Scriptures, could they repeat it all at their fingers end, but they that <hi>underſtand</hi> it right, <hi>apply</hi> it as they ought, <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt, and lead their lives according to the Scriptures, ſhall receive the reward promiſed in Scripture: otherwiſe, as he that <hi>knoweth his maſters will and doth it not;</hi> ſo he that knoweth the Word of God, and is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152516:99"/>moſt skilful in the holy Scriptures, and yet neither <hi>applies</hi> them right, nor <hi>believes,</hi> nor <hi>lives</hi> according to the Word of God, is worthy to be beaten <hi>with many ſtripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore Chriſt enjoyneth us to give unto his ſheep their own <hi>due portion</hi> of knowledge and ſpiritual food, that may <hi>edifie</hi> them and not <hi>deſtroy</hi> them; and that is ſuch a proportion as every one is <hi>capable</hi> of, and is <hi>requiſite</hi> for him to know. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we are to give to every one his <hi>own due portion</hi> of this ſpiritual food,
<note n="2" place="margin">In due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> both in <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>quantity,</hi> ſo we are to give it them in <hi>due ſeaſon,</hi> becauſe, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, there is <hi>a time for all things,</hi> as a time to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and a time to be <hi>ſilent,</hi> a time to <hi>feaſt,</hi> and a time to <hi>faſt;</hi> a time to <hi>preach,</hi> and a time to <hi>pray,</hi> which I fear is now cut <hi>ſhorteſt</hi> of all times, if not <hi>perſecuted,</hi> to hide it ſelf in <hi>corners</hi> and private Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, when as many of our Churches are ſcarce acquainted with the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> the prayer that our Saviour commanded us to uſe, <hi>Horrendum dictu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Chriſt our grand Shepherd hath commanded us to give to every one his <hi>own portion</hi> in <hi>due ſeaſon,</hi> ſo he hath warned and inſtructed his ſheep, not to <hi>take</hi> what they <hi>liſt,</hi> but to be ſatisfied with what is <hi>given them,</hi> and to expect it in the <hi>due time,</hi> and not to <hi>exact</hi> it <hi>whenſoever they pleaſe,</hi> becauſe God cannot endure that every man ſhould be his <hi>own carver</hi> and ſtretch forth his hand with <hi>Adam</hi> to any <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">God would not have men to be their own carvers.</note> when as every one ſhould be <hi>contented</hi> with what is <hi>given</hi> him, and ſhould <hi>pray</hi> to God as Chriſt hath taught us, ſaying, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt bleſſed the five Loaves and two Fiſhes, he did not as many of our <hi>new Divines,</hi> teach the people now to <hi>take</hi> what they <hi>liſt</hi> of the <hi>bleſſed bread</hi> in the Euchariſt, but as S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, he diſtributed them to the <hi>Diſciples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 6.11.</note> and the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>to them that were ſet down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas, here is our <hi>miſery,</hi> and the <hi>iniquity</hi> of theſe times,
<note place="margin">The miſery &amp; the iniquity of theſe dayes.</note> that our <hi>diſpenſers</hi> ſhall not <hi>diſpoſe</hi> this ſpirituall food, and God himſelf ſhall not <hi>diſtribute</hi> his own gifts; but, as the Poet ſaith, — <hi>Vivitur ex rapto,</hi> what God hath moſt <hi>graciouſly</hi> beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon one man, another will moſt <hi>wickedly</hi> ſnatch it from him: and men muſt and will have the <hi>Word of God</hi> expounded, extorted and <hi>multiplied,</hi> as Chriſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his loaves, when, where, how and by whom they liſt, which is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our calamities, and like, if not prevented, to bring <hi>deſtruction</hi> unto the ſheep of Chriſt. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt the <hi>good Shepherd</hi> doth not onely <hi>feed</hi> his ſheep, and bid S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him all us three times <hi>to feed his ſheep,</hi> that is, to feed them three manner of wayes.</p>

            <p>And he requireth of us likewiſe, that are his <hi>under-ſhepherds,</hi> that we ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all dangers to ſave and to protect our ſheep; and as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia civitatis ut ſit ſufficiens, trifaria eſt,</hi> the guard and <hi>ſafe cuſtody</hi> of Gods City, and <hi>ſheep-fold</hi> of Chriſt, if it be ſufficient, muſt be three-fold.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:152516:100"/>the blood of the Martyrs did fatten the <hi>field</hi> of Gods Church, and made it to bring forth fruits more abundantly.</p>
            <p>But now the <hi>coat</hi> of Chriſt is torn in pieces, far worſe then <hi>Jeroboams</hi> garment that was cut in ten parts, and the Church of God is filled with Sects and Hereſies, ſo that the poor ſheep of Chriſt know neither <hi>where</hi> the fold is, nor <hi>who</hi> is the <hi>true Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the time of the <hi>Arians, Novatians, Eutichians, Neſtorians</hi> and others, the like <hi>Hereſiarches,</hi> though they infeſted the Church with <hi>damnable</hi> doctrines, and as that traiterous villain,

            <p>But now,

            <p>And that we might be <hi>environed</hi> with enemies on all ſides, <hi>Hell is broken looſe,</hi> as <hi>Edwards,</hi> one of their own Presbyterians ſaith, and Satan is ſet at liberty, to poure forth, out of the bottomleſs pit, thoſe <hi>locuſts</hi> that you read of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.3. whoſe <hi>ſhapes</hi> were like <hi>horſes</hi> prepared unto battel, becauſe their whole heart is for <hi>war,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue their hands in <hi>blood,</hi> and to deſtroy all the <hi>true Prelates;</hi> and yet their <hi>hair</hi> were as the hair of <hi>women,</hi> that is very <hi>ſpecious,</hi> and <hi>lovely</hi> to behold, when they pretend nothing but a <hi>perfect Goſpel-diſcipline,</hi> and a pure <hi>Heavenly doctrine,</hi> beating downe the <hi>Antichriſtian Pope,</hi> and the worſhipping of Saints, Images, Pictures and all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties; but their <hi>teeth</hi> were as the teeth of <hi>Lions,</hi> that is, <hi>devouring</hi> all that ever <hi>we have,</hi> and all that ſhall come within their <hi>reach,</hi> as all the <hi>patrimony</hi> of the Church and all the <hi>fleeces</hi> of Chriſt his Flock, and their <hi>tails</hi> are like <hi>Scorpions,</hi> that have their <hi>ſtings</hi> in their tailes, to make the <hi>cataſtrophe</hi> and concluſion of their doings <hi>very grievous</hi> and moſt lamentable, as I fear it will be found at laſt, unleſs God will be ſo merciful unto us as to help us.</p>

<note place="margin">Luke 8.8.</note> 
               <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear;</hi> becauſe this <hi>hearing</hi> of his voice, is not only a ſpecial means to beget faith and obedience in us, but it is alſo the <hi>firſt ſtaff</hi> in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the <hi>firſt ſtep</hi> that we make towards the Kingdome of heaven: For S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that whom God hath</hi> predeſtinated, <hi>them he hath</hi> called,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> 
               <hi>and whom he hath</hi> called, <hi>thoſe alſo he hath</hi> juſtified, <hi>and whom he</hi> juſtified, <hi>them he alſo</hi> glorified: So that there is no <hi>glorification</hi> without we be <hi>juſtified,</hi> and no <hi>juſtification</hi> without we be <hi>called,</hi> and in vain are we <hi>called,</hi> if we do not hearken to the Voice that calleth us; and therefore, <hi>ad ſummum niſi a principio pervenire non potes;</hi> thou ſhalt never be glorified in heaven, except thou doſt hear the Voice of Chriſt on earth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>James</hi> adviſeth us, <hi>to be ſwift to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak;</hi> for which cauſe,

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>But here, by the <hi>voice of Chriſt,</hi> which the preachers are to <hi>explain</hi> unto the ſheep, the <hi>queſtion</hi> is, whether they ought to alledge or cite <hi>any other voice,</hi> or the voice of any other man, then what is ſet down by the divine <hi>Pen-men</hi> of the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> in the Canonical books of the Old and New Teſtament, which are the only wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that are of divine inſpiration, and infallibly true, without any commixion of any errour: For ſome will believe <hi>nothing,</hi> and would have nothing ſaid or alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but what is ſet down <hi>directis terminis</hi> in the holy Scriptures, that are the <hi>only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted</hi>

            <p>To theſe men I anſwer, that as I love their Zeal to Gods Word, ſo I pity their Ignorance of Gods Will; for they ſhould know, that as <hi>every lie</hi> is the voice of the Devil, who is <hi>a lier from the beginning,</hi> and the Father of all lies, as our Saviour ſaith, ſo <hi>every one</hi> that is of the <hi>truth heareth my voice,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: and as he is <hi>Pater lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> the Father of Lights, ſo he is <hi>Pater veritatum,</hi> the Father of Truths, and <hi>every truth qua truth,</hi>

<note place="margin">Galat. 1.8.</note> but S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That <hi>if an angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould preach to us any other goſpel then what was truth,</hi> he ſhould be <hi>accurſed,</hi> to teach us, that neither the worthineſs nor, the unworthineſs of the perſons ſpeaking, but the lawful commiſſion and authority of the ſpeaker, the truth of what is ſpoken, is moſt chiefly to be regarded by the hearers; and therefore Chriſt ſaith, The Scribes <hi>and Phariſees,</hi> that were wicked men, and his enemies, <hi>do ſit in Moſes chair;</hi> that is, they are lawfully called to teach the people, and to expound the law of God; <hi>All therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve,

            <p>And therefore, though the holy Scriptures primarily, infallibly and perfectly, without errour, be the voice of Chriſt, and the true Word of God, yet this denieth no, but that other Writings, either of holy Faith, witty Poets, and learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophets, or whoſoever they be that write the Truth, either Hiſtorically or Phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Morally, may ſecondarily be ſtiled the <hi>voice</hi> of Chriſt, ſo far forth as they are <hi>the words of truth:</hi> otherwiſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have cited three Teſtimonies of the Heathens, to juſtifie the truth of what he delivered, which was like the fact of <hi>David</hi> to cut off <hi>Goliah</hi>'s head with his own ſword, or as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> robb'd the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of their Gold and of their Jewels, when we take <hi>what is good</hi> out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine Authors, as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſheweth at large: <hi>De doct.

            <p>And if it were not lawfull and uſeful to quote other Authors, as the Voice of Chriſt unto the people, it had been but a vain thing, either for the Fathers of old, or for any other learned Divine now to write any thing at all, if their writings bare no credit, or was of no uſe, either with the Readers or the Hearers of their explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or ſhall we think that all the learned Authors, that have written ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You will perchance ſay, yes, they may be read by the Preacher, but not quoted and cited to the hearers; but as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith,

            <p>And the <hi>ſpiritual ſenſe</hi> is diſtinguiſhed to be three-fold <hi>allegoricall, tropological</hi> and <hi>anagogical;</hi> and the not underſtanding in what ſenſe the Scripture is to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, hath cauſed many great ſcholars to erre moſt foully, as <hi>Origen</hi> doth ſo allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the <hi>terreſtial</hi> Paradiſe, that he taketh away the truth of the Hiſtory, when for the <hi>trees</hi> he underſtands the <hi>Angels,</hi> for the <hi>rivers</hi> the heavenly <hi>vertues,</hi> and the <hi>coats of skin</hi> their humane <hi>bodies:</hi> and others have as foully erred in taking that litterally which ought to be figuratively underſtood, as <hi>Papias,</hi> and thoſe that follow him, <hi>Juſt.

            <p>And therefore I would adviſe all thoſe, that in doing ſervice unto God, by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the Tranſgreſſors of his Lawes, have raiſed themſelves to ſuch great Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,

            <p>And theſe three graces I find moſt excellently delivered and explained by three of the chiefeſt Apoſtles (the three worthieſt Pillars of Gods Church) S.

            <p>And no marvel, for he was indeed the Diſciple which our Saviour <hi>loved</hi> above the reſt, and before all the reſt of the Apoſtles; he was the chiefeſt child of Love, as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> calleth S. <hi>Paul</hi> the beſt Child of Grace: And therefore, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave himſelf principally to magnifie the <hi>free grace</hi> of God, ſo doth S. <hi>John</hi> wholly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf to amplifie the <hi>great love</hi> of God; and as he doth the ſame in all his works, ſo he doth it eſpecially in this my <hi>Text,</hi> which I may well call the Epitome of all his writings, and it containeth theſe two things, which contain the ſum of all Divinity.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>General,</hi> as the <hi>many</hi> manifold benefits that we continually receive from God, as he is the faithful Creator, a wiſe Preſerver, and a bountiful Beſtower of abundance

            <p>And in very deed, our <hi>love</hi> to his honour, and our <hi>care</hi> of his ſervice, and the <hi>maintaining</hi> of his truth, can never be near ſo <hi>much</hi> performed as we <hi>ought</hi> to do.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let others <hi>laugh</hi> at our <hi>too-much love</hi> to God, and our <hi>too hot zeal</hi> to promote his <hi>truth,</hi> and to maintain his <hi>ſervice;</hi> yet I ſhall never condemn the <hi>nature</hi> of thoſe men, that with the zeal <hi>Phinees,</hi> and the boldneſs of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> are ſometimes <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi> in theſe proceedings; but I ſhall blame them that know not <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>wherein</hi> it is fitting to be ſo; for in this our <hi>love</hi> to God, if it be directed to the <hi>right end,</hi> though we ſhould fail in the <hi>manner,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We cannot love God too much, nor near ſo much as we ought to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> love him.</note> yet we can never fail in the <hi>meaſure</hi> of loving God; becauſe, as when the <hi>ſubject</hi> of our hatred is <hi>ſin,</hi> it cannot be too <hi>deep:</hi> So when the <hi>Object</hi> of our love is <hi>God,</hi> it cannot be too <hi>high;</hi> and they that with the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> are but warm, when God requireth them to be <hi>hot,</hi> can never be <hi>freed</hi> from ſin; when their <hi>moderation</hi> is become a <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> and their <hi>Sobriety</hi> is belied into a <hi>Vertue;</hi> which had it been done by <hi>Elias, John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and the Fathers of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> we had been deprived of <hi>much truth,</hi> and they had failed of the Crown of <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>

            <p>And yet I ſay not that <hi>every</hi> Chriſtian doth, or can love God in ſo <hi>great</hi> a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as is required of him, or as <hi>many</hi> others have and do love him; for as there are <hi>degrees</hi> of faith,

            <p>The two firſt in my laſt Sermon.

            <p>And therefore this is the <hi>errour</hi> of the ſons of men,
<note place="margin">The errour of men.</note> not that we are ſubject unto <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and endued with the <hi>affections</hi> of Fear, Hate, Love, and the like; but that we <hi>misguide</hi> our Paſſions, and miſorder our affections, by <hi>miſplacing</hi> them where they <hi>ought not</hi> to be ſetled; for we may <hi>fear,</hi> ſo it be him that can caſt <hi>both body and ſoul into hell fire;</hi> we may <hi>hate,</hi> ſo it be the thing that <hi>is evill,</hi> and we may <hi>love,</hi> ſo it be <hi>what we ought,</hi> and as we ought to love.</p>
            <p>But this is that which God cannot endure, that we ſhould fear <hi>men</hi> more than God, or fear <hi>temporal</hi> loſſes, goods, or lands, more than the loſs of our <hi>ſouls,</hi> and the wounding of a <hi>good conſcience;</hi> or that we ſhould hate our <hi>brethren,</hi> and not their <hi>ſins,</hi> which we cheriſh in our <hi>ſelves,</hi> though we deteſt them in all <hi>others;</hi> or that we ſhould love the <hi>world</hi> and not God, or any thing in the world <hi>more</hi> than God, or ſo <hi>much,</hi> that it ſhould any waies <hi>leſſen</hi> our love to God.</p>
            <p>And therefore here I may <hi>ſtop</hi> my courſe, and ſtay a while, to reprove thoſe <hi>many millions</hi> of men that are, as the Philoſophers ſaid, <hi>The Citizens of the world,</hi> and do freely <hi>beſtow</hi> their loves, not on <hi>God,</hi> but either upon the <hi>vain pleaſures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The love of vain things choaketh our love to God.</note> or the <hi>vile profits</hi> of this wicked world.

            <p>For, as <hi>Apolonius Tyanaeus</hi> ſaith, That he hath ſeen a ſtone, called <hi>Pantaura,</hi> which is the <hi>Queen</hi> of all other ſtones, and hath in it <hi>all the vertues</hi> that are to be found in all the other pretious ſtones; So, to <hi>this ſtone</hi> do ſome men compare <hi>riches;</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Mat. 20.26, 27</note> The words of Chriſt, <hi>whoſoever will be great among you let him be your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and whoſoever will be chief among you let him be your Servant;</hi> the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> allegde them to prove a <hi>parity</hi> of orders and an <hi>equality</hi> amongſt all the Miniſters of Gods Church, and yet the very ſame words are produced by all the <hi>Fathers</hi> and all the moſt <hi>learned</hi> Divines, to ſhew the <hi>diverſity</hi> of our callings, and the <hi>ſuperiority</hi> of ſome of them above the others; which is indeed the <hi>very truth;</hi> becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he would never have ſaid, <hi>whoſoever will be chief,</hi> but he would have told them <hi>plainly</hi> and briefly, they were all <hi>equal,</hi> and none was <hi>chief,</hi> or none was <hi>greater</hi> than the reſt; but, in ſaying, <hi>whoſoever will be chief, let him be your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> he ſheweth the <hi>duty</hi> and humility that ſhould be in him which was to have the <hi>priority,</hi> and doth ſufficiently confirm the <hi>ſuperiority</hi> of ſome above the reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <note place="margin">Mat. 26.26.</note> The words of the conſecration of the Euchariſt, <hi>take eate this is my body;</hi> are interpretd by <hi>Bellarm.</hi> and all the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that quote the Authors of all ages, to prove the <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of that holy bread into the <hi>very body</hi> of Chriſt; and yet the very ſame words are expounded by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to prove their <hi>conſubſtantiation,</hi> and by the <hi>Fathers</hi> rightly underſtood, as they are <hi>amply</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Pet.

            <p n="3">3. The very ſame Scriptures to the number of forty places, were alleged by the <hi>Arians</hi> to prove their <hi>Damnable</hi> Hereſie, that Chriſt was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, of the <hi>ſame</hi> eſſence with God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Scripture which commandeth us,
<note place="margin">Matth. 22.21.</note> 
               <hi>to render unto Caeſar what is Caeſars and to God what is Gods,</hi> is <hi>truly alleged</hi> by moſt Divines to exact our full obedience to thoſe our <hi>juſt Soveraigns</hi> that do <hi>lawfully ſit</hi> on their royal thrones; and this is ſo <hi>preſſed</hi> by the true Expoſitors, that it may be obſerved, God requireth this <hi>duty</hi> to be performed, before his own <hi>dues</hi> ſhold be rendred.</p>
            <p>And yet when the <hi>right</hi> Kings are thruſt out by any <hi>Uſurpers,</hi> (as the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> were oftentime expuſſed, and ſince many <hi>lawful Kings</hi> have been unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dethroned) the very ſame Scripture is ſtill alleaged by ſome other falſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, to require <hi>obedience</hi> to thoſe <hi>powerful intruders</hi> that ſeem to have the lawful authority.</p>
            <p>So when the <hi>Lawful Governours</hi> of Gods People are undecently reviled, the anſwer of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to them that ſaid unto him, <hi>revileſt thou Gods High-prieſt?</hi> When he replied, <hi>I wiſt not, brethren that he was the High-prieſt, for it is written, thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Ruler of the people,</hi> is <hi>juſtly</hi> urged by moſt of the beſt Interpreters, to condemn the upbraiders of <hi>juſt authority;</hi> And yet the ſame exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is produced by ſome other ſpurious divines, to require the <hi>like obedience</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding and <hi>uſurping Governours,</hi> when they have got the power, and have <hi>attained</hi> unto the authority, though by very <hi>unlawful</hi> wayes.</p>

            <p>Becauſe now, as you may ſee out of <hi>Joſephus, Appian,</hi> and other Hiſtories both of the Greeks and Romans, and out of the Books of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> ever ſince <hi>Pompey</hi>'s time were become <hi>Tributaries,</hi> and were tied by many <hi>other Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> for their defence againſt <hi>Antiochus</hi> and other enemies, unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> to become Tributaries unto them; and the <hi>Scepter</hi> was now quite departed from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> when <hi>Herod</hi> that was an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> had quite extirpated all the <hi>Royal</hi> Line, and they had not then any <hi>other</hi> more <hi>Lawful</hi> viſible Soveraign, then <hi>Caeſar,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And the example of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is more clear, that as he gave no <hi>Reverence,</hi> ſo he deemed <hi>no obedience</hi> to be due to the <hi>uſurped</hi> power of <hi>Ananias,</hi> when he ſaid <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited Wall,</hi> that is, thou <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> for <hi>ſittest thou to judge me after the Law, and commandeſt me to be ſmitten contrary to the Law?</hi> And if you ſay, that he <hi>recalled</hi> himſelf, and recanted his Errour, by acknowledging his <hi>Fault</hi> (as ſome Expoſitors, that is, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Cyprian, qui videntur hanc Interpretationem

            <p>Therefore though his <hi>Reply</hi> might be ſome excuſe for his <hi>Maleloquy,</hi> which <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> would not uſe againſt Satan, yet this <hi>Example</hi> gives no <hi>countenance</hi> to the yielding of <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Uſurped</hi> Authority, unleſs you will conclude S. <hi>Paul</hi> to be either <hi>very ignorant,</hi> or a <hi>very great Diſſembler,</hi> which is very <hi>injurious</hi> to think of ſo <hi>holy</hi> an Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe of <hi>Athaliah</hi> puts this out of all doubt, becauſe the had the <hi>Power</hi> and the Government, and the <hi>Authority</hi> ſetled upon her, about the ſpace of ſeven years, yet becauſe ſhe had no <hi>Right,</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Tertull. ad Scapulam</hi> makes this moſt clear; where he ſheweth how tender the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were to preſerve the right to the lawful Emperours, and therefore though <hi>Albinus</hi> was moſt powerful in the Weſt, and <hi>Piſen Niger</hi> in the Eaſt, yet the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would be <hi>nec Albiniani, nec Caſſiani, nec Nigriani.</hi>

            <p>Yet this much I muſt tell you, that where the <hi>right heir</hi> is not <hi>apparent,</hi> as it was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152516:127"/>not amongſt many of the Primitive Emperours, who were often lifted up to that royal dignity by none other right than the <hi>Sword</hi> of the tumultuous Souldiers, and unconſtant cohorts, and were therefore obeyed by the good Chriſtians, becauſe they knew not of any <hi>other</hi> that had any <hi>better</hi> right unto the Empire, the ſame as yet being <hi>unſetled</hi> to continue in any hereditary line.; or when the <hi>just</hi> Title to the Crown is not <hi>cleered,</hi> as perhaps it was not to all the Subjects in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. and <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. and the like <hi>doubtful</hi> claimes, then it is not for every <hi>private me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick</hi> or ignorant Ruſtick to determine the <hi>right</hi> to the Crown, and decide the <hi>equity</hi> or the <hi>iniquity</hi> of ſuch powers; but as the Apoſtle ſaith, and as it was moſt <hi>learnedly</hi> handled by a moſt Reverend and a moſt <hi>learned Prelate</hi> of our Church, not long ſince in this place, <hi>they ought to ſtudy to be quiet,</hi> to follow their own Trades,

            <p>And in this <hi>qualified</hi> ſence you muſt underſtand and not <hi>miſtake</hi> the meaning of the ſame moſt <hi>Reverend Prelate</hi> in this place upon our laſt Kings day, that when it is <hi>doubtful</hi> to <hi>whom</hi> the right of the <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> ſhould belong, or <hi>who</hi> hath right unto the <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> then all <hi>ignorant</hi> and private men are excuſed though they <hi>reſiſt not</hi> the Government that hath the <hi>preſent power</hi> over them, but do obey the ſame, eſpecially by their <hi>paſſive obedience,</hi> and likewiſe by their <hi>active obedience</hi> in all honeſt and <hi>lawful</hi> demands.</p>
            <p>All which, with all that I ſaid before, I ſay to clear the <hi>integrity</hi> of the ſaid Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelates <hi>intention,</hi> from any <hi>ſiniſter</hi> apprehenſion of <hi>miſunderſtanding hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi>

               <p>A certain poor man had a <hi>Pick-axe</hi> wherewith he got his living; and there was a certain <hi>rich man,</hi> his Neighbour, that coveted the ſame, and finding it, on a time, left where the poor man wrought, ſtole it from him, ſo that the poor Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer was fain to provide another, and after many years, and the memory of the <hi>Pick-axe</hi> quite forgotten, the rich man driving ſome of his Cattel to the Market, a luſty fellow, that had ſtollen a couple of <hi>Oxen,</hi> drove them among the rich mans Beaſts, and after a while, fearing to be apprehended, by the ſearch and cry, that he perceived to come after him, he prayed the rich man to drive his <hi>Oxen</hi> a little way, while he went a Furlong or two, to deliver a Letter to ſuch a Gentleman, and the rich man, ſuſpecting no evil, did ſo; but not long after, the ſearchers for the <hi>Oxen</hi> found them with the rich man, driven towards the Fair amongſt his own Beaſts, and apprehending him, proſecuted him ſo eagerly, and the rather, becauſe he was a rich man, that he was condemned to die for ſtealing of thoſe <hi>Oxen;</hi> and being upon the Ladder, complaining of this injuſtice, and profeſſing his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy herein, he ſpieth a <hi>Kite</hi> flying up and down over his head, and crying, as he conceived, for the <hi>Pick-axe,</hi> for the <hi>Pick-axe;</hi> whereupon, his Conſcience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, he cryed out, that God was juſt, and his judgement right; for though he was innocent from the <hi>Oxen;</hi> yet he long agone, had ſtolen a poor mans <hi>Pick-axe,</hi> for which God now brought him to this end; ſo no doubt, many a <hi>Thief</hi> and <hi>murtherer,</hi> may eſcape for the <hi>robbery</hi> and <hi>murders</hi> committed by them; and yet may ſuffer for that which they never knew, which is moſt juſt with God, though unjuſtly done by men.</p>
               <p>And ſo God might juſtly, though moſt mercifully too, ſuffer the enemies of this good King to condemn him for what he never did, becauſe he might offend God in ſome other things, for which he was never blamed by his enemies, nor accuſed by the Parliament.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:152516:130"/>
               <p>And let no man wonder, nor blame me for ſaying, that the King, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good a King, and ſo pious a man, ſhould notwithſtanding fail, and offend God in ſome things, when the Apoſtle tells us plainly, that in <hi>many things we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all.</hi> For as there is no condition of life, be it never ſo happy, but it hath his croſs, to ſhew unto us, that perfect felicity is to be expected elſewhere: ſo there is no Prince, nor any man living, be he never ſo wiſe, but he ſometimes erreth, and be he never ſo virtuous, but he will ſometimes offend, elſe ſhould he prove himſelf to be more then man, becauſe, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I anſwer, that the wiſeſt of the Kings friends conceive them to be not thoſe things, for which his enemies warred againſt him, and condemned him moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly; but might be thoſe things, wherein, contrary to his own free deſires, he yielded to the deſires of his enemies: and thoſe you may finde in the Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory</hi> his <hi>Diſcovery of Myſteries,</hi> to be thoſe three principal miſtakes, and not denied to be ſo by the King himſelf, when Secretary <hi>Falkland</hi> would for thoſe things, have ſuppreſſed that Book; but the good King told him, they were true, and ſo ſuffered the Book to be publiſhed.</p>

And this was a moſt Chriſtian courſe in him; for I may juſtly ſay,
<q>Victima ſacra Deo res eſt ſuccurrere Cleris:</q>

               <p>And as our Saviour ſaith of them, <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me:</hi>

<q>

And when the <hi>King</hi> underſtood, what his Lords and Commons conceived <hi>fitting</hi> to be done, He, with the Advice of His Council, ratified what he approved, and rejected what he diſliked, with the uſual phraſe in that kind.</p>
               <p>But in proceſs of time, the Parliament-men (as I heard wiſe men ſay) began to incroach more and more upon the Rights of Majeſty, upon the Power, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King, eſpecially of thoſe Kings that either had no Right, or, at the beſt, but doubtful Titles unto the Crown, or thoſe that were of leſs Abilities, or of an eaſie, and facile diſpoſition, and would ſoon be perſwaded, by the importunity of their People, to yield to many things that they deſired. And what Favours, and Priviledges they thus obtained from theſe Kings, they challenged as their Right and Due from the ſucceeding Princes; and the more Favours, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they obtained, the more ſtill they deſired, and at laſt in ſome Parliaments, from <hi>Adviſers,</hi> the Members thereof would fain become <hi>Directours,</hi> and inſtead of being <hi>Counſellours,</hi> they aymed to be <hi>Commanders</hi> of their <hi>Kings,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that they ought and muſt enact what Laws, and do what things, as they concluded ſhould be done: But, ſeeing as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Flumina magna vides parvis de fontibus orta,</hi> ſmall Springs do often make great Rivers; therefore, to prevent the increaſe of this growing Miſchief, to allay the Diſeaſe, before the Sore grew to be incurable, and to quench the Flame, before the Fire burnt the Houſe, the wiſe and prudent Kings retained always, in their own hands, the power to diſſolve the Parliament whenſoever they pleaſed; that, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them together, when they thought <hi>good,</hi> ſo they might diſmiſs them, when they liſted, either when all things were reaſonably concluded, or when they conceived the Parliament men to become unreaſonable in their Demands; which was the firſt Signal Evidence of the Ambitious Deſire of <hi>Kingly Majeſty</hi> in the Lord <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour,</hi> when he diſſolved the Long Parliament; which made me to believe, he aymed to be a <hi>King.</hi>

So that this good King might well cry out with the Poet,
<q>Heu patior telis vulnera facta meis:</q>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:152516:131"/>
               <p>Indeed, <hi>Golias</hi>'s Head was cut off with his <hi>own</hi> Sword; but <hi>David</hi> took it from him <hi>perforce,</hi> and <hi>Golias</hi> gave it not, neither could he hold it, when he lay at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s feet: when as the King was not ſo, when he paſſed this Act, but he might have eaſily denied to paſs this Bill of an <hi>indiſſoluble</hi> Parliament; which had never been an Act, had he not given his <hi>conſent</hi> unto the ſame, which in a ſhort time after made his Enemies <hi>Kings,</hi> and unkinged him; and the Lord Protectour was hereby put in mind of his Grammar Leſſon, <hi>Foelix, quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum:</hi> and therefore he never gave to his Parliaments ſuch advantage againſt him.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, that the Parliament deceived the good King, who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſooner deceived, becauſe he was good; for as the Oratour ſaith,

And I muſt confeſs, that as it was wickedneſs in them to deceive the King, ſo it was want of good Counſel in him to be deceived, and ſuffer himſelf to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by them: for had he conſulted with God, and by God's Miniſters, that were now to be all tumbled down, I believe theſe <hi>Foxes</hi> of Satan ſhould not have enſnared his Majeſty; becauſe they could have ſufficiently informed him, how the <hi>Old Serpent</hi> hath Emiſſaries enough to deceive, if it were poſſible, the <hi>very Elect.</hi> And therefore, as he was as innocent as the Dove, ſo he ſhould have been as wiſe as the Serpent, to avoid the Stings, and to finde out the Windings of the Infernal Serpent; and one man's head, though the wiſeſt among many, is ſcarce ſufficient to pierce into the Plots and Subtilties of many heads. And if you ſay, he had his Counſellours; true, and I could name them; and they were great ones too, and wiſe men too: but, as I ſaid before, they were not the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt, the Counſellours that are ſent for God; for their Advice was not ſuffered at this time to be deſired, their preſence was to be excluded, and themſelves ſhortly to be impriſoned. And therefore, as <hi>Lucan</hi> ſaith,
<q>
                     <l>Hoc placet, ô Superi, cùm vobis vertere cuncta</l>
                     <l>Propoſitum, noſtris erroribus addere crimen.</l>
                  </q> Therefore, as the King, though unwillingly gave way to theſe Foxes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and to exclude God's Miniſters from his Counſels; ſo God might juſtly give way for his Counſellours, to betray him to his enemies, by yielding to their Deſires, to have an <hi>everlaſting Parliament,</hi> thereby to end him, and to remain as Kings themſelves without end.</p>
               <p>Some other Miſpriſons, it may be, the good King might commit, of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152516:132"/>and not ſo eaſily to be obſerved, though eaſily paſs, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, in great affairs.</p>
               <p>But howſoever, for all that this good King did, and in all the things, that he ſuffered or have happened unto him, you may ſee that God is juſt in all his ways and holy in all his Works, and how the Judgments of the great God, as they proceed from him, may eaſily be juſtified by the weakeſt of men.</p>

               <p>He had paid him dear for his place, therefore he muſt take great Fees, and ſell juſtice, or he ſhall loſe much by the Bargain; for indeed, he cannot ſell cheap, that buyeth dear, and be a ſaves thereby; nor can he prove, but very ſeldom, an upright Judge, that hath bought his office, and by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obtained his place: and therefore this ſelling of the <hi>Chancellour</hi>'s office, and other places in the Biſhops Courts was the root of all the corruption that were of thoſe Courts; and ſo the <hi>Biſhops</hi> that did this, even for theſe faults, beſides the neglect to redreſs their other abuſes, can not, in my judgement, be any ways excuſed.</p>

                  </q> So, to put weapons into their hands, to enable them to war with their Biſhops: it was the practice of ſome of the Biſhops (if we may believe the common report of the Country <hi>Mercury</hi>) to beſtow Livings, Rectories, Prebends, and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152516:135"/>not on ſuch worthy Scholars, and Academicks, as beſt deſerved them, but either upon their own Friends, Children, Kinsmen, or Servants, or on ſuch, as, according to the old <hi>riddle,</hi> could tell them, who was <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>'s Father, and his Mother too; and could ſay Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Leſſon, <hi>Aurum, &amp; argentum non eſt mihi,</hi> the clean contrary way.</p>
               <p>And this very practice of thoſe Biſhops, that did ſo, bred ill blood, and many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humours againſt the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> function; as eſpecially,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A diſdain of them amongſt thoſe worthy men, that were ſo careleſsly neglected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A neglect of God's People, and leaving them untaught, and unguided by thoſe unworthy men, that were thus promoted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A general diſtaſt of the people againſt all the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> when they reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe diſtempers, that were onely cauſed by very few.</p>
               <p>And all theſe things cryed to God for redreſs, and for judgement againſt the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that were the Authours of theſe evils; and ſo, as all the Mariners were toſſed for <hi>Jonas</hi> his ſin, ſo all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> muſt ſuffer for the offence of few.</p>

               <p>And this diviſion of <hi>Reuben,</hi> with the aforeſaid diſtempers, was a great preſage of their preſent fall; yet I believe not all the cauſe, that moved God to permit the Devil to ſtir up Enemies to throw them down, but the true cauſe was greater ſins, if I judge right, then either of theſe: for the former might be the aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Enemies, and but onely the allegation of ill-willers without any ſound ground for their Juſtification; or, if true, but the Acts of ſome few of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and the Diviſions of the Clergy might leſſen our repute, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our Authority, but not utterly to overthrow our <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> as all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Primitive Church never did.</p>
               <p>And therefore the true cauſes of our ruine muſt needs be of an higher nature, and they might be, beſides the forenamed, and ſome others, that we know not of, theſe three main faults, that can neither be denied, nor excuſed.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152516:136"/>buſineſs ſo eagerly, to the great prejudice of the King; which was, to ſpeak what I conceive to be truth without flattery, ſuch an Epiſcopal offence, as cannot be expiated with words, nor could be defended with the power of the King, as the <hi>Scots</hi> alleadged,
<note place="margin">Non omnibus unum eſt, Quod placet; hic ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas colligit, ille roſas.</note> and which I conceive to be the Original, and the Seed of all the King's troubles, and misfortunes, and the Biſhop's overthrow, <hi>mittere falcem in alienam meſſem,</hi> to buſie themſelves out of their own Dioceſs, eſpecially among the <hi>Scots,</hi> that were bewitched with the love of the Presbytery, and hated all forms of Liturgies, but ſuch as was without form, or beauty: like Chriſt at his Paſsion, that was then, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>without form, or beauty;</hi> for had they reſted quiet, without raiſing up thoſe Northern blaſts, and thoſe Spirits, that they could not lay down, they might, no doubt, in my Judgement, have remained quiet to this very day; but they, throwing theſe ſtones into the Air, they fell into their own fore-heads, and they verified the old Proverb, <hi>Qui ſtriut inſidias aliis, ſibi damna dat ipſe,</hi> he that diggeth a pit for another, ſhall fall into it himſelf; for, by troubling the <hi>Scots</hi> with the new ſervice, they pull'd an old houſe upon their own heads, and an unſpeakable trouble upon the King, and this Kingdom, as they ſoon felt it afterwards, and all the people ſmarted for it.</p>

<note n="2" place="margin">Great fault of the Biſhops.</note> When they had troubled theſe unſavory waters, and raiſed up theſe foul Spirits, that they could not binde, and had engaged the good King in this bad cauſe, they neither juſtified the King with their pens, nor aſsiſted him with their purſes, near ſo much, as ſo good a Patron, both of them, and of their Churches had deſerved; but, as men ſtupified with that ſtorm, that the Parliament had raiſed, they were tongue-tied in his Cauſe, and hand-bound for any great help, or aſsiſtance they afforded him, againſt his, and their own enemies.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152516:137"/>for, had they been well vers'd in theſe things, and had underſtood them well, I ſhould have thought it not poſſible for the Devil to have filled them with ſo much poyſon, as they have ſhewed, both againſt their King, and againſt their Biſhops; and that, juſt like the Coy-Duck,

               <p>Thirdly, Seeing the Biſhops, whom they deemed no more, then their Equals, to be preferred before them; and conceiving themſelves thereby to be neglected, they both hated the King for his choice, and envied the Biſhops for their places; and becauſe they were not capable to work any other revenge, their <hi>Tongues were their own,</hi> and they let fly their Arrows, even <hi>bitter words,</hi> both againſt our obedience to the King, though cunningly, and obliquely; and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the Calling of the Biſhops, making that nothing, wherein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had nothing to do.

               <p>Fourthly, The next thing, that made them to ſtart aſide, like a broken Bow,
<note n="4" place="margin">Ambition:</note> was not ſo much their envy againſt the Biſhops, as their ambition to obtain their places; and their ambition, which, as the Scholeman ſaith, is one of the Daughters of Pride, failing to lay hold of what it went about, or that preferment, which they ſought, made them to flie out againſt the Biſhops; and, as <hi>Arius,</hi> miſsing the Biſhoprick of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> became the Father of the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, and <hi>Aerius,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writeth, being denied the Biſhoprick, that he required, did firſt broach that Hereſie, that there was no difference betwixt a <hi>Presbyter</hi> and a <hi>Biſhop:</hi> ſo the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> haughty ſpirit breaketh forth to diſcontent, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, to traduce, to maligne, and to abundance of other evils, not eaſily to be diſcovered; for, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>Facillimè ad res injuſt as impellitur, quisquis eſt altiſſimo animo, &amp; gloriae cupido;</hi> He is moſt eaſily induced, to do very unjuſt things, that is of an high minde, and ambitious of glory, and great places;

<note n="2" place="margin">The <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Clergy.</note> For thoſe Clergy-men, that were not the Members of the falſe Prophet, but were Royaliſts, and the approvers of the Epiſcopal Function, and yet have not eſcaped the fierie tryal, but have been driven through fire, and water, and have ſuffered many heavy things, to be plundered of their Goods, deprived of their Livings, and often times detained in Bonds, or driven to flie from their houſe, and home; I ſay, that, beſides other cauſes, beſt known to God, into whoſe ſecrets we dare not dive, we know good reaſons, that they were not thus hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without good cauſe, nor any ways unjuſtly dealt withall by the juſt God: as ſpecially, if there were nothing elſe, but becauſe they were not

               <p>And therefore, when they neglected their duty, to do what in their Conſciences they were perſwaded they ſhould do, it was moſt juſt that they ſhould ſuffer what they would not ſuffer, becauſe the ſins of omiſſion are as puniſhable, as the ſins of commiſſion, and he that is not with me, ſaith our Saviour, is againſt me, and he that gathereth not, ſcattereth abroad, and ſo (the Angel curſed <hi>Meroz,</hi> and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bitterly the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not forth to help <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt <hi>Jahin</hi> King of <hi>Canaan;</hi>) and ſo they are juſtly puniſhed, that, being in their hearts for the King, they did not with their tongues, hands and purſes, do the uttermrſt of their endeavours to aid, and aſsiſt the King; for as the Poet ſaith,

O let ns never do ſo again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For thoſe that approved of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and had ſubſcribed to the <hi>Articles,</hi> and allowed the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our Church, and were in their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces perſwaded of the purity, and excellency thereof, the ſame being compoſed by thoſe godly Martyrs, that weeded all ſuperſtition, and ſuperfluities from it, and then ſealed the reſt, that was inoffenſive, and pious with their blood; and the ſame alſo, being juſtified by all the convocations of all the Biſhops, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ever ſince and accordingly confirmed by acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> throughout the reign of four moſt pious Princes; for the ſpace of well near one hundred years; for them, I ſay, through hope to ſave, and to retain their livings, and ſo for the love of the World, to comply with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and to embrace their directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo indirectly to ſerve God, every <hi>Preſbiter</hi> after his own fancy, and to omit the whole ſet form of God's Worſhip, injoyned to be obſerved in all Churches,

               <p>Let them therefore that will, if not out of faction, or ignorance, but for the love of their livings, reject our inoffenſive, and divine <hi>Liturgy,</hi> that is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to peace, and good order, ſo little obnoxious to any juſt exception, and ſo exceeding profitable for the inſtruction of the people: for mine own part, I know it to be the true ſervice, of the true God, and the beſt way that I know to ſerve God; and therefore, by God's help, I will never omit it, nor be guided by their directory for all the livings, that they could, or can heap upon me; and, I pray God, it be not layd to their charge, that to comply with the factious oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of it, or to retain their livings have done it, to betray the ſervice of God, and to lay aſide thoſe heavenly prayers, that were made by holy Saints, and approved by all the beſt Doctours of the Church, and appointed by authority, to be uſed to help the devotion of God's people, and in the ſtead thereof to authoriſe, or at leaſt by their example to encourage every Ignoramus to prate nonſence, and ſometimes to belch out blaſphemies in his prayers to God, and in the face of the Church, without ſhame; God forgive them.</p>

               <p>But, if fear of the Prevalency of the Parliament was now ſo powerful with them, as to binde their hands, and to ſhut their Purſes from the King, what was the reaſon they were ſo ſlow, and did ſo little aid him, either with men or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, when, in all probability, the King had the better, or at leſt ſtood at even terms with his enemies, and then might with a little help, and a ſmall weight added, turn the Scales, and ſo ſubdue his Adverſaries, and prevent all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and diſaſters that have happened ever ſince? Surely, here can be made none other anſwer, nor any excuſe alledged, but the ſame reaſon that the <hi>Merozites</hi> had to ſhut their mouths, ſtop their feet, and hold their hands, till they did ſee who ſhould prevail, and under whoſe wings they thought to ſhelter themſelves, when all the brunt was paſt,
<note place="margin">The true cauſe of the neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of moſt men in this Kingdom.</note> without danger; or, at leaſt to come off upon very reaſonable termes. And this was the cauſe of the neutrality of the moſt men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the greateſt men of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And is it not therefore moſt juſt, that this pannick fear, and punick faith ſhould ſuffer the puniſhment that ſuch perfidiousneſs deſerved? that he which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the ſweet,
<note place="margin">How juſtly theſe men were puniſhed by ſuffering all that fell upon them.</note> juſt, and <hi>eaſie Yoke of Christ,</hi> ſhould undergo the bitter, hard, and <hi>cruel Yoke</hi> of <hi>Satan?</hi> or that they, which undutifully neglected, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do a little help, which their Conſcience told them, they ſhould do for their King, that expoſed himſelf to the hazard of his life, and loſs of his Kingdom, for to maintain the Service of God, and to defend their Laws, and Liberties; ſhould bear the full Meaſure, and Weight of that puniſhment, which they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Yes certainly, <hi>me judice,</hi> theſe, of all others merited to be ſcourged with Scorpions and not laſhed with twigs, and I pray God, their deſerts do not light upon their heads, when as, neither plundering, nor compoſition, nor taxes can Paralel that greatneſs of their offence, that deſtroyed both the King and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by their deſerting of them.</p>
               <p>Therefore, whatſoever miſeries, taxes or ſervice, or any, other Trouble, of the like nature hath fallen on any perſon of this claſſes,
<note place="margin">The greatneſs of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> let him ſay, and he ſhall ſay but the truth, that God hath, not onely moſt juſtly dealt with him, that had ſo unjuſtly neglected his King, but hath been more mercifull unto him, then either his offence deſerved, or with any reaſon could be expected.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152516:141"/>and as induſtrious as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that laboured more then any of all the Apoſtles, yet were he not able to anſwer God one of a thouſand, but he muſt lay his Hand upon his Mouth, and opening the ſame, he muſt ſay with Holy <hi>Job, If I waſh my ſelf in Snow water, and make my hands never ſo clean;

<note place="margin">When we do never ſo well God may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh us, though not for that our well-doing, but for ſome other evil-doings, that we had done at ſome other time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or for ſome defect in our well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Why God puniſheth the loyal Subject, and his owne moſt faithfull ſervants.</note> but unto us ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Faces.</hi> And therefore how faithfull, and how conſtant ſoever theſe ſeemed to be, both in the ſervice of God, and diſcharging their duties unto the King, yet muſt they confeſs, they failed in many things of that degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which God requireth at their hands in both reſpects, they neither ſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God as they ought, nor being ſuch Subjects unto thir King, as the ſtrictneſs of God's Law requireth. And therefore I ſay, Firſt, that in all our ſufferings, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever calamities we have endured, and what preſſure ſoever lyeth upon us, we muſt all confeſs, that, either for our delinquences, and miſcariages in theſe times, or ſome other offences, committed by us, at ſome other times, we are moſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and farr leſs then we deſerve, afflicted, and puniſhed by God, whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on us, as upon all others, are always moſt righteous, and juſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, that there is <hi>crudelitas parcens, &amp; miſericordia puniens,</hi> a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which is cruelty, and a puniſhment; that is a great mercie; and ſuch are the troubles, preſſures and puniſhments of God's Children, mercies rather then judgments; becauſe they proceed not from God's Wrath, but as the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Father to his Children, ſo do theſe come from the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſervants, for their good, whom he afflicteth here for a moment, that they ſhould be bettered, and not be condemned with the Wicked hereafter for ever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay, that the Miſeries, Croſſes, and Calamities, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> that the Faithfull ſuffer in this World, are not always ſo much a puniſhment for their Sins, <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>And therefore whatſoever, and how great ſoever a meaſure of Miſeries, Croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Troubles, we have or ſhall ſuffer; yet let us not faint, nor be affraid of them: and let not the Children of God be like the Children of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that being Harneſſed and carrying Bows, and ſo well prepared for the fight, yet turned themſelves back in the day of Battaile, when there was moſt need of their aſſiſtance; but as we have loved our King, and have ſuffered all the calamities and burthens, that are layd upon us, for our faithfulneſs to him, and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a good conſcience, ſo let us continue unto the end, and never comply with any of the King's Enemies, in the abatement of the leaſt jot of our love, and good opinion of the deceaſed King, or with the Factious <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> in the dis-ſervice of God, and the new invented Religion of our upſtart Schiſmaticks; let neither weight of trouble, nor length of time change our minds: becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in Faith, and Virtue is that, which crowneth all the other Virtues;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152516:142"/>and if at any time, even at the laſt, we forſake our firſt love, and change our Faith we loſe all the reward of all the former good, that we have done, and do, by our revolt, teſtifie, that we were not good, for the love of goodneſs, nor adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the truth, for righteouſneſs ſake; but for ſome other by-reſpects, for our own ends, that never brings any to a good end: and therefore the primitive Chriſtians could never, by any means, be drawn, to alter the leaſt point of their Faith,
<note place="margin">Prudent De Vincéntio.</note> and the right ſervice of God; but, as <hi>Prudentius</hi> ſaith,

               <p>All the Torments, and Terrours of the World could never move them, to change their mindes.</p>

               <p>And therefore it is no wonder, nor any fault-unexcuſeable, for the beſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller to miſtake his way in the dark, or in a wilderneſs among the thickets:</p>
               <p>But could any wiſe man, that remembered the former paſſages betwixt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the late pious <hi>King,</hi> think, or any good Chriſtian believe, that God (whoſe ways are always right, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>and the juſt ſhall walk in them;</hi> but <hi>the transgreſsors ſhall fall therein</hi>) would proſper the counſel that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to any erroneous courſe? no, no; this cannot be. And therefore, as I conceive; the Counſellors of this good Prince failed, though, not in their love and faithfulneſs to their Maſter, but in their advice in directing him the beſt way; and he, not knowing which way was beſt,

               <p>But his Counſellors may anſwer, as a very learned <hi>Scotchman,</hi> diſcourſing hereof anſwered me; that their purpoſe was right, and their intention exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, aiming at the ſame end, as is now, bleſſed be God for it, come to paſs.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, the juſt God will not approve of our intentions to do good, if we go about to effect that good by an evil way: for, as the Scholes tell us, <hi>ſi bonum feceris malâ intentione, non imputabitur tibi pro bono,</hi> if thou doeſt good, with an ill intent, it ſhall not be imputed to thee for good; ſo in like manner, <hi>ſi malum feceris boná intentione, non imputabitur tibi pro bono,</hi> if thou doeſt evil, though thou meaneſt never ſo well, and thine intention be never ſo good; yet ſhall it not be imputed to thee for good; becauſe the God that is moſt perfect in all his ways, and in every thing, doth require that the good which we do, ſhould be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, <hi>ex omni parte,</hi> on all ſides, and in every reſpect: for as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>He requireth truth in the inward parts,</hi> and will have heart, and hand, minde, and tongue to go together; and therefore we may not do evil, that good may come thereof, or to enable us to do good,

               <p>And therefore if this good Prince had been well informed, and throughly given to underſtand all the former paſſages, and proceedings of thoſe <hi>Scots,</hi> that ſo undutifully, ſo unkindly, and ſo treacherouſly dealt with his good Father, and for what ends they did it, I believe he would have never wandred thoſe ways that he travelled unto them; but he having thus miſtaken his way, he miſſed of his end, and the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that had made a Covenant with death, as the Prophet ſpeaks of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and an agreement with Hell it ſelf, did not ſtand any ways to further his deſign: but, when the overflowing Scourge did paſs through, then were they troden down by it; and he had been likewiſe troden down himſelf, or taken, which had been worſt, had not the eye of Heaven, which ſaw the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his heart, not wittingly offending in any way, watched over him, and as he did, when he led <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> that he might eſcape his Brother's wrath, ſo it guided him, moſt miraculouſly, in man's judgment, to the haven where he would be, that ſo, he might eſcape the treachery of ſome profeſſed friends, and be delivered from the malice of his cruel enemies: for I fear we may ſay, with <hi>Obadiah, All the men of thy confedracy have brought thee even to the border,

<note place="margin">Why God doth ſo ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</note> becauſe every perjured perſon makes a mock of God more then moſt of other Sinners do: either denyeth his wiſdom, as not thinking him to know all things; or elſe argueth him of injuſtice, as not regarding the innocent, and conniving with the faults, and malice of the moſt falſe and wicked men, which the Lord will never endure.</p>
               <p>And yet with theſe ſweet <hi>Scots,</hi> theſe over zealous Saints,

               <p>And truly, their Plots, and Devices, their Actions, and Proceedings, during the time, were ſo Unnatural, ſo Unjuſt, ſo Ungodly, and ſo Unparallel'd in any Hiſtory; and withall ſo ſubtilley, and ſo inexplicably contrived, that I muſt needs confeſs my learning wants words to expreſs them, and my underſtanding is not ſufficient to comprehend, how many, and how vile they were, how odious unto God, and how injurious unto men; and therefore I onely deſire my reader, to take that ſatisfaction from me herein, which I have ſet down concerning their doings in the foregoing Treatiſes, that I ſet forth, of the Diſcovery of Myſteries, and the Revelation of the great <hi>Anti-Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for which doings, the Lord God hath, if not ſufficiently, yet apparently ſhewed his juſt Wrath, and Indignation againſt them, many ways.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, In the reducing of their chiefeſt Plots and Devices to nothing, though, out of his patience and long-ſufferings he ſuffered them for a while to proſper, and to walk on ſtill, and to proceed in their wickedneſs: for they intended, like thoſe Gyants that built the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> to erect ſuch a frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in theſe Kingdomes, that they only and their Poſterity and Succeſſours ſhould ſit at the Stern, to turn and guide the ſame, as the thirty Tyrants did for a while in <hi>Athens,</hi> ſo long as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> endureth; and to that end they deſtroyed their King, they ſuppreſſed the Biſhops, they excluded the Lords, and then framed ſuch an Engagement, as might infringebly oblige and tie all the inhabitants of theſe dominions, to adore them, for their good Maſters and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours for ever.</p>

               <p>Or if it was not for this cauſe, as I heard ſome confidently ſay it was, yet for what cauſe ſoever, this, or any other, and with what minde ſoever, this Lord accepted that office, as being loth to ſtain his Honour, and Ambitious to retain the Fame of an honourable Soldier, I never heard the King, nor any other of the Nobility, accuſing him, for any baſe, ignoble, and perfidious act, that he did againſt his Majeſty, other then a fair enemy, and a pious Adverſary uſeth to do; this I muſt need ſay of him, that I never heard any man ſpeak otherwiſe of him.</p>
               <p>But how did the juſt God like of theſe his doings, how fairly ſoever carried, you may conceive by the ſucceſs, ſo far as man can judg of things; for he was worſted at <hi>Edg-Hill,</hi> the firſt Field that he fought, where he was fain to hide his head in the day of Battel, and the next day to retire, not without ſome Diſhonour, to <hi>Warwick</hi>-Caſtle; and afterwards in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> he was forced to abandon, and leave his whole army, and glad to take the Sea, to carry him back to the rebellious City: for which, and for ſuch other the like diſaſters, that the Parliament conceived, they that ſo ſolemny ſwore a little before, that they would live, and dy with him, do now Vote a diſpenſation of that Oath, and diſcard this unfortunate, though not unhonourable head, and chooſe another in his room; and his Lordſhip, not without ſome diſgrace, is diſrobed of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; and, leaſt this potion might, in time, through diſcontent, work ſome bitter effect, againſt them, that gave it him, as the like hath done to many other rejected, and degraded Officers, that are moſt ſenſible of diſgraces, their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy produced a double paſſion, of Fear, and Hate, and theſe cauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to think, that all remedies are too weak for the Danger; and do force them to apply more violent Phyfick, then either the quallity of the Diſeaſe, or the Conſtitution of the diſeaſed can ſuſtain; and therefore it is generally reported, and of moſt of the King's Friends, believed, they gave him a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>-fig,
<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Eſsex</hi> ſuſpected to have been poyſoned.</note> ſome <hi>Aconites</hi> that wrought too ſtrongly upon his Body, that it ſoon brought his head into the Grave; And thus was he rewarded for his good ſervice unto the Parliament, and the ill offices he did againſt his King, God in juſtice ſuffering the People,
<note n="2" place="margin">Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> and his Son.</note> that magnified him, to deſtroy him, which is the Common fruit of Popularity,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next perſons that I ſhall inſtance are Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152516:150"/>his Son with him; whom I ſhall put both together, becauſe both were in the ſame fault of diſloyalty, to the King, and both taſted of the ſame ſauce, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the like puniſhment. This man was the firſt that ſo unjuſtly, and ſo inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly durſt preſume to enter into <hi>Hull,</hi> the King's own proper Town, and there to ſeize upon the King's Magazine, and his own peculiar goods, and when the King came in his own perſon to require admiſſion into the ſame, he very undutifully, and uncivilly, to ſay no worſe, refuſed to receive him in, but kept him out, with unſeemly terms of denial, and, as they ſay, with a great deal of Scorn, and Contempt.</p>
               <p>And how did the juſt God approve of theſe unjuſt doings? You may gueſs by the ſubſequent puniſhment, which both the Father, and his Son have undergone And truly I cannot think of their puniſhment, but I muſt remember the Story, that you may finde in <hi>Herodotus</hi> touching <hi>Hermotimus,</hi> and <hi>Pamicetius:</hi>

                     <hi>Herodot.</hi> lib. 8.</note> for <hi>Hermotimus</hi> taken Priſoner in War, was ſold unto <hi>Pamonus,</hi> that was a baſe Merchant, and which made a Trade of very diſhoneſt gain; for,
<note place="margin">The Story of <hi>Hemotimus,</hi> and <hi>Pamonius.</hi>
                  </note> ſeeing that gelded Youths, were much more ſet by for all manner of ſervices among the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> then thoſe that were ungelded, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> alledgeth <hi>Cyrus</hi> to have therefore committed the keeping of his body rather to <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> then to others, this baſe Merchant bought all the fair Boys, that he could get for money, in all Ports, and Faires, where he went to buy them, and then gelding them,
<note place="margin">The great price of <hi>Eunuchs.</hi>
                  </note> he went to <hi>Sardis,</hi> or <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſold them again, almoſt for their weight in gold; therefore he uſed <hi>Hermotimus</hi> after the ſame manner, and they ſold him to one, that among other gifts preſented him to King <hi>Xerxes,</hi> with whom, in ſucceſs of time, he grew into greater credit then all the other <hi>Eunuchs;</hi> and <hi>Xerxes,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War upon the <hi>Graecians,</hi> took <hi>Hermotimus</hi> with him, who was ſent upon ſome buſineſs to the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Chios,</hi> where finding his old friend <hi>Pamonius,</hi> he took acquaintance with him, and recounted unto him the great happineſs, and the great benefits he enjoyed, by his adventure, and the good that <hi>Pamonius</hi> had done him; and therefore promiſed, that, if he, and all his Family would remove to <hi>Sardis,</hi> he would enrich him with much wealth, and advance him to great honour; which offer, the Covetous, and Ambitious Merchant willingly accepted, and ſoon tranſported himſelf, with his Wife, and Children, and all his whole family thither; to whom <hi>Hermotimus,</hi> when he had him within his power, ſaid, O thou the moſt Wicked of all men, that uſeſt the vileſt, and moſt deteſtable Traffick, that can poſſibly be deviſed: what hurt, or diſpleaſure didſt thou ever receive at my hands, or through my means, that of a man, am now made of thee, to be neither Man, nor Woman?

                  </note> and juſtice unto all, have moſt juſtly delivered thee, as a moſt wicked Wretch, into mine hacds, that thou mayeſt finde the juſt puniſhment, which thy wickedneſs hath deſerved: ſo he cauſed his four Sons to be preſently brought into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and compelled the miſerable Father to geld them all with his own hands, and then he forced the diſtreſſed Children to geld their own Father.</p>
               <p>So when Sir <hi>Hotham,</hi> and his Son, had moſt diſloyally played their part, in the Houſe of Commons, againſt the King, and then more egregiouſly, by ſeizing upon <hi>Hull,</hi> and with very undecent uſage, and reviling terms, denying the King entrance into his own Town, as I ſaid before, had ſhewed themſelves to be, as they were, arrant rebels, and ſtiff Traytors, the Parliament, within awhile after, finding, that theſe falſe fellowes had played foul with them likewiſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting them of their former Wickedneſs, or rather, as I conceive corrupted with the greedy deſire of ſome great reward, promiſed by ſome of the King's Friends, that knew how to catch ambitious Worldings, had reſolved to comply with his Majeſty, and to deliver his Town, and Magazine unto him, they, like <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus,</hi> having moſt cunningly gotten them into their hands, wrought the Son, in hope to get pardon for himſelf, to accuſe, and to betray his Father; and then,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152516:151"/>with the like Subtlety, and for the like hope, they brought the Father to accuſe his Son: and ſo being both found guilty, and condemned, they chopped of both their Heads, as the juſt reward of their former Wickedneſs; God now rendring unto them what they had before ſo well deſerved, and ſuffering them willingly, and wickedly to do that to each other, which <hi>Pamonius,</hi> and his Sons did moſt unwillingly, to be the Authors, and inſtruments of each others Puniſhment: which ſhould be a warning to all Transgreſſors, to fear the <hi>Vengeance</hi> of <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note n="3" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Brooks.</hi>
                  </note> The next Member of the Long Parliament, that I ſhall ſet down in my Catalogue of diſloyal Subjects, is the Lord <hi>Brooks;</hi> a man, whoſe former life, and Converſation (which I knew by his own penitent Epiſtles and Letters, that, from beyond the Seas, he wrote to his Unckle Sir <hi>Fulk Grevil,</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> who ſhewed them unto me) was very looſe, and diſſolute; and how, in a ſhort time, by ſome ſtrange Converſion, far unlike Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, he paſſed from one extream to another,
<note place="margin">Four remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things concerning the Lord <hi>Brooks.</hi>
                  </note> from a very diſſolute Youth, to a moſt reſolute Saint, I know not: but out of many remarkable things, written of him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his death, I ſhall onely ſet down here theſe few particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That, as in his former looſeneſs, he wholly neglected the Commands and grave Counſels of his Unckle Sir <hi>Fulke Grevil,</hi> that was his Governour, <hi>&amp; loco Parentis,</hi> his Maintainer, and upon my Knowledge a very bountiful Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of him too; ſo afterwards in his too much preciſeneſs, he did in like manner wholly reject his Duty, and Obedience to his King, that was <hi>Pater Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi> and a very gracious King to him too; yea, he became a very obſtinate, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, and a moſt virulent Oppoſer of his King; as if he could not be a Saint in the Service of God, except the became as a rebel to oppoſe his King: but ſo it is moſt commonly ſeen, that they, which are undutyful to their Parents and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, will ſeldom prove faithful to their Kings or Princes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I obſerved that our of his ſuperabundant zeal, which he pretended to God's Honour, he extremely hated, and perſecuted the Governours of God's Church, and the chief Upholders of God's Service, the reverend <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and and all the grave and learned <hi>Doctours</hi> of God's word; and he was no leſs a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faner of God's Houſe, which is the material Temple, and the place, <hi>where God's Honour dwelleth,</hi> while the Saints are Pilgrims in the Wilderneſs of this World.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It is not unknown to moſt that knew him, that he could not endure to have this Epithete, and Title of <hi>Saint,</hi> to be given either to <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> or <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;</hi> and eſpecially to any other departed Saint or Servant of God, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and the like, though he could not deny them to be with God in Heaven; as if the Saints in Heaven, for fear of <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Superſtition,</hi> were not to be acknowledged for Saints now on earth, but that this Sanctity muſt be appropriated onely to themſelves, that are ſuch furious <hi>Zelots</hi> againſt the reverend eſteem we bear to the Saints in Heaven, though we neither invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them for help, nor adore the beſt of them with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> no more then they: but knowing, that not one is in Heaven, but he is a Saint, we give this Title of Saint to them, of whom we doubt not of their being bleſſed with God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> He had another property, no leſs injurious to himſelf, and the Servants of God on earth, then the former was to the Saints in Heaven; for that excellent Prayer in our <hi>Letany,</hi> and the holy deſire of God's Servants, that it would pleaſe God to <hi>deliver</hi> them <hi>from ſudden Death,</hi> which all good Divines, and faithfull Servants of <hi>God</hi> did ever acknowledge for a temporary Judgement of God, and therefore prayed, that, whenſoever it pleaſed him to call for their Souls out of this earthly Tabernacle, he would be pleaſed to grant them ſome time and ſpace to call upon him, for the <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of their Sins, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Souls into his Hands, and ſo forth. Yet this Lord could not away with the Prayer, nor abide to hear of this Petition; but would have every man,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152516:151"/>at all times to be ſo prepared for death, that he needed not at any time to pray againſt ſudden death, and we ſay likewiſe, that every man ought to expect death in every place, and to do his beſt endeavour to be prepared for death at all times; yet, that neither this Lord, nor the beſt Saint on earth can be ſo well prepared at any time, but that he ought, as he hath need, to pray for pardon of the Defects, and Imperfection of his Preparation; and therefore to pray for time to make that Prayer, and then, as for time to diſpoſe, and fit himſelf for God, and to make his peace with him through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo to ſet his Houſe in order, as the <hi>

               <p>But here in this Lord we may behold, and adore the Judgment of the juſt God, how that as <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Head was cut off with his own Sword, ſo, <hi>Judicium ſuum ſuper caput ſuum,</hi> this man's Judgment and his practice fell upon his own head, and the Stone, that he threw at another, lighted upon his own Pate: for in the Proſecution of his hate againſt his <hi>King,</hi> as a juſt reward of that Service, his Lordſhip being in <hi>Litchfield</hi> on Saint <hi>Chad</hi>'s day, the Founder of that Church, while he viewed the College, or Cloſe, as they tearm it, and Church of Saint <hi>Chad,</hi> to batter them down with his Canons, for the Fideliy and Allegiance of that Fraternity unto their King, being all harneſſed, <hi>Cap-a-p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> from top to toe, as he lifted up his Helmet to ſee the ſame more clearly, behold you, and ſee the juſt hand of God directing the hand of a youth, that was a <hi>Prebend</hi>'s Son, with a Fowling-Piece, to hit him juſt in the eye; that, as formerly he could not ſee the truth, ſo now he could ſee nothing, but fell ſuddenly dead, and never ſpake word, no, not ſo much as, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me:</hi> ſo the Lord God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf juſt, and righteous in his Judgments, and holy in all his ways; and let all the Sons of men acknowledge the ſame, and all wicked men fear his Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Fourthly The next man,
<note place="margin">Fourth Man.</note> that I ſhall bring upon the Stage to anſwer at the Bar of Juſtice, is Maſter <hi>John Pym;</hi> a man, that was in an Office of great truſt, and of much profit, and gain under the King: and becauſe, as the Proverb goeth, <hi>Much would have more,</hi> his Covetousneſs egged forward by his Ambition to be great, ſnatching at more then was juſt, laid him open to loſe what was due, and to be deprived of his place, that was ſo good. Then he, like the unjuſt Steward ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Goſpel, took unjuſter Courſes againſt his Maſter; for he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſed with himſelf to detain more of his Maſter's goods in his hands, and to deceive him of ſo much, as might well enable him to live well, and in good ſort, as his falſe fellow-Steward, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeakes of, had ſhewed him the way before, but as after Ages grew more ſubtle, ſo they became more wicked, then the former times, even ſo this unjuſt, and unthankful Servant became more wicked then before: for now he layeth up ſuch hatred, and malice againſt his King, and ſealeth it in the depth of his Heart, wherein the ſame boyled like new Wine, that wanted vent, ſo that, it was like meat, and drink to an hungry Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, for him to finde any Opportunity to broach the ſame againſt the King. And the Long Parliament, that conſiſted of very many diſcontented Perſons, and men both disaffected to his Majeſty, and diſtaſting his preſent Government, made him a fair way to lay open all his Malice, and what he formerly vented in his private Diſcourſe by retail, he doth it publickly now in groſs, and he doth it to the full: and having a tongue apt to ſpeak, and not unskilful in the art of Rhetorick, he begins firſt to make his Oration againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as knowing, that whatſoever evil was proved or conceived againſt him, the ſame reflected moſt upon the King; then, after the taking of this great Earl, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Counſellour of the King, out of the way, making more bitter Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſty, then ever <hi>Cicero's Philippicks</hi> were againſt <hi>Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:152516:152"/>or his Actions againſt <hi>Verres,</hi> he ſo ſtill paſſed on, till he had poyſoned the greater part of that Houſe, and the ſeditious vulgar, that underſtood his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, with an evil conceit againſt the good King.</p>
               <p>And now ſeeing himſelf back'd with the wilde part of the Houſe, and the ſtrength of the rude multitude, no mean revenge will ſerve his turn, but with his Rhetorical Orations, and Speeches, filled with Gall againſt the King, though as yet ſomewhat obliquely, he labours to disrobe, and rob the King of all his chief Friends under the Notion of evil Counſellours; and withall ſecretly complies with the <hi>Scots</hi> to aſſiſt him, and the reſt of his ſeditious Compeers againſt his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>But, the King having full intelligence both of his, and his partners vile pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice againſt his Majeſty, laboured to bring them to their Tryal in the uſual legal way, for their underhand Treachery, and Confederacy with the <hi>Scots</hi> to bring a foreign Army to invade his Dominion; and then to ſave himſelf, and the reſt, they fly to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and in a ſhort ſpace drew the Citizens, and, with them, the whole Kingdom to engage themſelves, in a deſperate civil War againſt their lawful Sovereign.</p>
               <p>Then the King found himſelf too weak, to bring this ſtrong Rebel, to any trial; yet the hand of God was not to ſhort to fetch him out of his guarded Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; for he is the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and hath as well his great Army of little ones, as the Rats, and Mice, that devoured <hi>Popiel</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Polonia, in anno</hi> 830. for his treacherous poyſoning of his Unckles; the Moales, that undermined a City in <hi>Theſſaly;</hi> and the Worms, that deſtroyed <hi>Herod</hi> the King; as alſo his ſtrong Army of great ones, as the earth to ſwallow up <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram,</hi> the Sea to overwhelm <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Hoaſt, the Stars in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der too fight againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> and his Angels to be at his Command, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his enemies.</p>
               <p>And therefore he ſent his Serjeant to arreſt him, and to fetch him out of his ſtrong hold, that he ſhould do no further Miſchief againſt his Anointed. And how he died, I leave to the Report of them, that knew the manner of his death better then I can ſet it down.</p>
               <p>I did intend further to ſhew unto you the juſt Judgment of God upon Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Hamden,</hi> that for his diſloyalty to his King was ſhot, whereof he dyed, on the ſame Plot of ground, where he firſt muſtered his Souldiers againſt his King; even as the Lord threatened the like Judgment againſt <hi>Ahab.</hi> And upon the Mayor of <hi>York,</hi> that, on that day twelve-Moneth, that our King loſt his life, made a Bone-fire for joy, that the King had ſo loſt his life, but on the ſame day twelve-Moneth after hanged himſelf. And eſpecially upon Colonel <hi>Axtel,</hi> that hath been the ruine of ſo many Churches, and the Suppreſſour of ſo many honeſt conformable Miniſters, and other good Proteſtants, and plaid ſo many Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical parts about <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and in my Dioceſs of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> as I am not able in a ſhort time, and with few words to expreſs it: and upon divers others, but my Occaſions at this time will not give me leave to perfect what I have begun.</p>
               <p>And therefore I muſt now here make an End, and commend us all to God, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi> to whom <hi>be all glory, and honour for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>OEternal, Almighty, and moſt merciful Lord God, that haſt created all things by thy Power, governeſt them by thy Wiſdom, and preſerveſt them by thy Goodneſs, and haſt diſpoſed all thy Creatures to be for the Service of man, the Sun to give him light by day, and the Moon by night, the Earth to feed him, and the Angels of Heaven to attend him, that he daſh not his foot againſt a Stone; for all which great love, and bounty of thine towards man, thou requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt no more, but that he ſhould be thankful unto thee, and praiſe thee for thy goodneſs, and declare the wonders, that thou doeſt for the Children of men; and, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, what doth the Lord our God require of us, but to fear the Lord our God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord our God with all our hearts, and with all our ſouls, and to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Statutes, which he commanded us for our good: for the diſcharging of which duties, and the performance of our Service unto the Lord our God, though, as Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith, the moſt High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, when as the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him, which is above the heavens, and below the earth, and filleth all places, and beyond all places with his Preſence; yet our fore-Fathers moſt religiouſly, according to the Preſident, that King <hi>Solomon</hi> left us, and the good Examples, that the Primitive Chriſtians gave us, have erected Oratories, and built Temples, and Churches, where the Saints, and Servants of God might meet, to praiſe the Lord for his manifold mercies; to beg his favour, and graces, to help, and to ſupply their wants, and neceſſities; to underſtand his Will, and to know his Commands, and to do all other the beſt Service, that they could do, to the Lord their God; and to that onely end they have ſet them apart, and alienated them from all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and prophane uſes, dedicated them wholly for God's Service, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated them by Prayers to be Sanctuaries for them, and their Poſterities to ſerve, and to honour God in.</p>

               <p>Yet thou, O Lord God, like a moſt gracious Father, didſt not ſuffer thy wrath to burn like fire, to encreaſe more and more, and to continue, as our Iniquities continued, but in the midſt of thy Judgments thou haſt remembred thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and commanded thy deſtroying Angel to put up his Sword, and to puniſh us no more, but to turn our heavineſs into joy, by rooting out our Oppreſſors, and the Depravers of thy Service, and reſtoring to us our moſt gracious King: for which great Bleſſings, and ineſtimable favours of thine, O gracious God, we laud, and praiſe thy glorious Name, and we will thank thee, and magnifie thee for ever.</p>
               <p>And now, O Lord, ſeeing we are taught by thy holy Prophet, that Holyneſs becometh thy Houſe for ever; and thou haſt commanded thy people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould keep their Tents, and Habitations holy, and clean, leſt thou, that can'ſt abide no impurity in thy ſight, ſhouldſt depart from them; which was a Type to ſignifie unto us, how much more holy, and clean, thou would'ſt have us to preſerve thy Houſe, where thy Service is celebrated, thy Name magnified, and thy Preſence promiſed to be aſſiſtant unto thy Saints: we do therefore in all humility beg of thee, and from the bottom of our hearts beſeech thee, to blot out, and pardon all the Abuſes, Prophaneneſs, and Wickedneſs, that hath been done in, and againſt this Houſe: and we pray thee to accept of theſe our Prayers, and Supplications unto thee, to ſanctifie the ſame, and to make it a fit place for thy Service; and ſo to preſerve it an holy Tabernacle for thy Majeſty, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with thy Saints, to have thy Name magnified, thy people inſtructed, and their Petitions preſented unto thee; and, when they do pray unto thee in this place, do thou hear them out of thy holy Heaven, and let thine Eyes be open towards this Houſe, night and day, even towards this place, of which thou haſt ſaid, My Name ſhall be there; and thy dear Son, and our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> hath ſaid, Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, I will be there in the midſt of them; and this Houſe, being erected for the gathering together of thy Saints, dedicated for thy Service, and by our Prayers conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for thy Worſhip; we do moſt humbly beſeech thee to be preſent amongſt us, to hear our Prayers, to grant our Requeſts, and to give us ſtrength, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us through thy Grace to finiſh the Reparation of this Houſe with Joy, and to thy Glory, which with ſuch Alacrity we have begun, and we pray thee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to guide us by thy bleſſed Spirit to walk according to thy Will, that our ſins may not provoke thee, to ſuffer the Sectaries, and the Enemies of thy truth, and the Depravers of thy divine Service to prophane the ſame any more; grant this O bleſſed Lord for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his ſake, to whom be all Glory, and Dominion for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
